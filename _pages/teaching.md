{% include base_path %}

I teach a range of courses both at the undergraduate and graduate levels (see
my [Academic C.V.]({{ base.url }}/files/vita.pdf) for a complete list). But I also engaged in teaching-related activities that go beyond the courses I teach.

### WRENCH Pedagogic Modules

Thanks for funding from the [NSF](http://nsf.gov), 
we have developed the [EduWRENCH
Pedagogic Modules](https://eduwrench.org).
These modules  are _self-contained_, _simulation-driven_, _in-the-browser_ pedagogic
activities that can be integrated into courses to achieve learning
objectives in the area of distributed computing, in the context of
scientific workflows, via hands-on experiments.

### SMPI CourseWare

Using the [SimGrid Project](http://simgrid.org) as a foundation, I have
developed the [SMPI Courseware](https://simgrid.github.io/SMPI_CourseWare/).
This courseware consists of _self-contained_, _simulation-driven_,
pedagogic activities that can be integrated into courses to achieve
learning objectives in the area distributed-memory parallel programming
using [MPI (Message Passing Interface)](https://www.mpi-forum.org/).
