{% include base_path %}

I teach a range of courses both at the undergraduate and graduate levels (see
my [Academic C.V.]({{ base.url }}/vita.pdf) for a complete list). But I also engaged in teaching-related activities that go beyond the courses I teach.

### WRENCH Pedagogic Modules

As part of the [NSF](http://nsf.gov)-funded [WRENCH
Project](https://wrench-project.org/), we have developed the [WRENCH
Pedagogic Modules](http://wrench-project.org/wrench-pedagogic-modules/).
These modules  are _self-contained_, _simulation-driven_, pedagogic
activities that can be integrated into courses to achieve learning
objectives in the area of distributed computing, in the context of
scientific workflows, via hands-on experiments.

### SMPI CourseWare

Using the [SimGrid Project](http://simgrid.org) as a foundation, I have
developed the [SMPI Courseware](https://simgrid.github.io/SMPI_CourseWare/).
This courseware consists of _self-contained_, _simulation-driven_,
pedagogic activities that can be integrated into courses to achieve
learning objectives in the area distributed-memory parallel programming
using [MPI (Message Passing Interface)](https://www.mpi-forum.org/).
