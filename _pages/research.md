### Research Interests


My research area is High Performance Computing (HPC), and in particular
parallel and distributed computing for scientific application workloads. 
For example, I have done work in the following areas:

  - Application scheduling and resource management algorithms
  - Software frameworks for execution scientific applications
  - Design of HPC systems (network topologies, fault-tolerance, physical layouts for 3-D multi-chip systems)
  - Modeling and simulation of parallel/distributed computing platforms and applications

See my [Publication page]({{base.url}}/publications/) for all details.

### Current Research Projects

Most of my current research focuses on the simulation of parallel and distributed computing systems, with a large emphasis placed on HPC systems. Two key projects are:

<a href="http://simgrid.org">The SimGrid project</a>, which I initiated
more than 20 years ago but has taken a life of its own thanks to a bunch of
talented people who've made it better than I could ever have, is a
<b>simulation framework</b> for building <b>scalable</b>, <b>accurate</b>, simulators
of parallel/distributed applications, systems, and platforms.

<a href="http://wrench-project.org">The WRENCH project</a> is
a <b>simulation framework</b> that sits on top of 
<a href="http://simgrid.org">SimGrid</a> and makes it possible
to implement scalable and accurate simulators of complex cyberinfrastructure systems
<b>quickly</b> and <b>easily</b>.
