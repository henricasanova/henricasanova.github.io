My research group is called **DisCo** (Distributed Computing), and 
we do research in several areas, most of which fall under the High Performance Computing (HPC) umbrella.
In particular, over the years we have done work in the following areas:

  - Modeling and simulation of parallel/distributed computing platforms and applications
  - Simulation-driven parallel and distributed computing education
  - Application scheduling and resource management algorithms
  - Software frameworks for distributed scientific applications
  - Design of HPC systems (network topologies, physical layouts for 3-D multi-chip systems)

See my [publications page]({{base.url}}/publications/) for papers in the above, and other, areas.

### Current Research 

Most of our current research focuses on the **simulation of parallel and distributed computing systems**, with a large emphasis placed on HPC systems. Current projects include:

  - [The SimGrid project](http://simgrid.org), which I initiated
more than 20 years ago but has taken a life of its own thanks to a bunch of
talented people who've made it better than I could ever have, is a
**simulation framework** for building **scalable**, **accurate**, simulators
of parallel/distributed applications, systems, and platforms.

  - [The WRENCH project](http://wrench-project.org) is a **simulation framework** that sits on top of 
[SimGrid](http://simgrid.org">SimGrid) and makes it possible
to implement scalable and accurate simulators of complex cyberinfrastructure systems
**quickly** and **easily**.

  - [The EduWRENCH project](http://eduwrench.org) provides **pedagogic modules** for teaching/learning principles of parallel and distributed computing via **simulation-driven activities in the browser** implemented using [WRENCH](https://wrench-project.org).

  - [The WfCommons project](http://wfcommons.org) provides a set of community tools and resources for enabling scientific workflow research and development. 

  - [The Workflows Community Initiative](https://workflows.community/).
