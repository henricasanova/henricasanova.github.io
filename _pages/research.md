My research area is High Performance Computing (HPC), and in particular
parallel and distributed computing for scientific application workloads. 
For example, I have done work in the following areas:

  - Application scheduling and resource management algorithms
  - Software frameworks for execution scientific applications
  - Design of HPC systems (network topologies, physical layouts for 3-D multi-chip systems)
  - Modeling and simulation of parallel/distributed computing platforms and applications
  - Simulation-driven parallel and distributed computing education

See my [publications page]({{base.url}}/publications/) for all details.

### Current Research Projects

Most of my current research focuses on the simulation of parallel and distributed computing systems, with a large emphasis placed on HPC systems. Two key projects are:

  - [The SimGrid project](http://simgrid.org), which I initiated
more than 20 years ago but has taken a life of its own thanks to a bunch of
talented people who've made it better than I could ever have, is a
**simulation framework** for building **scalable**, **accurate**, simulators
of parallel/distributed applications, systems, and platforms.

  - [The WRENCH project](http://wrench-project.org) is a **simulation framework** that sits on top of 
[SimGrid](http://simgrid.org">SimGrid) and makes it possible
to implement scalable and accurate simulators of complex cyberinfrastructure systems
**quickly** and **easily**.

  - [The EduWRENCH project](http://eduwrench.org) provides **pedagogic modules** for teaching/learning principles of parallel and distributed computing via **simulation-driven activities in the browser** implemented using [WRENCH](https://wrench-project.org).
