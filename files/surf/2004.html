 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 7AM-9AM, tide going out (6.4ft, 4AM:1ft, 12PM)  <li> with Dario and Brad. Not too crowded (6-7 people).  <li> big. average sets above 6ft, up to 8ft.  <li> not a clean swell at all. very bumpy, gnarly.  <li> The paddle out was really long and arduous, as the  supposed channel was closing out at 4-5ft  <li> Caught one way early in the session, made the drop, rode  a section and got wiped out by white water. Paddling back  out was long. Only wave of the session.  <li> I could have made a drop on a 9 footer, left (the rights  were just a wall), but pulled out as it was too steep for me.  <li> Brad said he rode the fastest and most powerful waves of  his life. Dario caught only 2 waves.  <li> paddling in was tough as there was a 30 yard impact zone in the  channel. Took me about 20 minutes of paddling in, looking back,  paddling back out to avoid a big set. Finally saw an opening and  paddled in as fast as I could. A big set crashed 5 yards behind  me and the white pushed me all the way in. Dario got in by catching  the gnarliest wave I've ever seen him ride I think  <li> Spent some time on the cliffs checking out the waves. The conditions  were definitely big, scary, and unclean.  <li> Good experience, but not "fun". Definitely good stories to tell though </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 10AM-12PM, tide going out (7ft,7AM:-1.3ft,2PM)  <li> with Dario. Crowded.  <li> Big. some sets in the 9-10ft range.  <li> Got caught on the inside with Dario during a huge set with  something like 30 waves. rather ridiculous. the water was  all messed up afterwards and we ended up about 100 yards north  of the spot.  <li> Some guy, obviously scared, talked to me in the line-up about  trying not to die and getting the boards ripped off our hands.  Whatever. Feels weird not to be the worst kook out there anymore.  <li> Finally caught a 9 footer way on the outside. My best  ride ever. Had to go around one guy on the face. Wish  I had been able to generate speed to escape the white toward the  end of the ride. wiped out not so far from some guy in the inside,  waved at him to check whether he was ok. Only wave of the session.  <li> Paddled right back out to avoid a MASSIVE set. Was 20 yards further  outside than everyone else, and made it. everybody got wiped  out. Dario got really pummeled, went down deep, with his board  dragging him further down! He was a bit shaken after that.  <li> Caught some white in 15 minutes later without much trouble. Got  back to the parking lot and checked out waves for a little while.  <li> Good experience, but wishing for smaller sessions now. Feel like  charging on 4ft waves. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Mission Beach, 6:30AM-8AM, tide coming in (7.3ft, 9AM)  <li> with Dario and Patrick, only the 3 of us out there.  <li> Waist high with some head high sets, quite a few close outs.  <li> Beautiful morning, but my surfing sucked. Dario says it's  normal after a big session.  <li> Could really get my feet far apart enough, but still caught  10+ waves.  <li> Did a pathetic take-off and fall right next to Dario (could  have hit him with my board I think). Later Dario almost  hit Patrick with his board when they got caught on the inside.  <li> Still, a pretty nice way to start the day.  <li> 2 seals. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 7AM-8:45AM, tide coming in (7ft at 10AM)  <li> with Dario and Brad, only the 3 of us out there.  <li> waist- to head-high, not very consistent.  <li> It was supposed to be a big day and it wasn't. Brad was  a bit down in the morning and Dario thought that Subs sucked  so bad that we should check another place. We went to check  "indicator" and "combs" right down the road, but it wasn't good.  We ended up going to subs anyway, and it turned out much better  than we though, especially for me given that I was the only one  with a long board out there.  <li> Caught a lot of waves, with one good take-off, and one good ride.  Still have my feet WAY too close together on take-offs unless  they're steep. Really need to fix that.  <li> Got caught on the inside a bit, but nothing bad.  <li> Waves were too mushy for B or D to have a really good time, but  they were still having fun.  <li> Decided to get out of the water at the "rope" because the  tide was too high. While waiting for a wave in this big wave  (7-8 ft) came in while Dario and I were on the inside. I ditched  the board and dove, but still was pushed down pretty far. Opened  my eyes to see everything black and starting to swim towards the  surface. Probably the deepest I've gone while surfing. Not too  foamy at the top, so that was good.  <li> Finally caught a lame left-hander in, with a very bad take-off,  but at least didn't have to paddle in  <li> Going up that rope is ok with somebody up and somebody down  passing the boards up, but on my own, with a long board,  no way. One wave came crashing against the cliff and it was  a good thing I had grabbed Dario's board just before </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 7AM-8:45AM, tide coming in (6ft at 10:30AM)  <li> with Dario, 6 people in the line-up.  <li> Dario called me in the morning at 6AM and told me to  go to MB instead of SC. But when I got there the surf  started to get bigger and the weather report was saying that  a storm was coming in, so we drove to SC anyway.  <li> In the parking lot we realized that Dario had forgotten his  booties (and it was COLD!), had no wax on his board, and that  I had forgotten my rashguard. Laughed my ass off as Dario was  putting on his wet rashguard. It turned out to be OK without  booties, but he had a few slips on his board.  <li> Great waves, but strong wind that made them hard to catch  and bumpy, and made the ride rather awkward. Left-handers  mushy and not very exciting, great right-handers as we discovered  at the end of the session.  <li> Caught about 8 waves. One fantastic right hander (so did Dario),  and the rest were mellow left-handers.  <li> Almost dropped in on some guy as I had a very hard time pulling  out of the wave, but managed to do it in the end.  <li> Went back to Dario's house for nutella toasts and tea, watching  surfers having a good time until the wind picked up. No idea  why it wasn't windy here earlier.  <li> 3 dolphins in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Mission Beach, 7:30-8:30AM, tide going out (1ft at 11AM)  <li> by myself, although Dario was in his house, packing for  his 1-year trip to Australia/Bali/Italy  <li> knee- to chest-high  <li> pretty crappy conditions, many close-outs, didn't  really have any ride, although I had 2 ok drops. The  tide seems a bit all over the place.  beautiful morning though.  <li> 2 dolphins </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2004_Jan_30">Fri 30 Jan 2004</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Del Mar, 6:30AM-8:30AM, tide going out (0ft at 11AM)  <li> with Travis, and then Geoff and Kate  <li> knee- to head-high.  <li> good conditions, had about 15 rides.  <li> I still have crappy style and have trouble picking up speed  on the wave, especially after bottom turns.  <li> On a big wave I think I may have dropped in on somebody, although  it wasn't completely clear (I was outside, and I really need to  get it into my head that being outside does not mean I have  the right of way over people on the inside closer to the break!!).  Travis saw the whole thing and he told me that he couldn't tell  whether I had actually dropped in, which comforted me. There was  so much white I just couldn't see anything while I was dropping.  But then I had to do a bottom turn around Geoff, lost all speed  in that, he got caught in the white, so was I, and when I emerged  from under the water his board was 5 inches from my head. That  could've been bad. It was partly his fault because he lost his  board on the turtle, but I would also have lost my board on that  kind of turtle :) All in all,  if I had been able to maintain speed,  I would have been ok.  <li> Then on another wave I dropped in on someone, but somewhat on  purpose. I had seen him and tried to bail. Sort of managed  to bail out, but rather late and not very effectively. When  he paddled back out he told me I wasn't supposed to drop in  on people, and I apologized. No hard feeling and a good vibe  overall (in fact he hooted for me on one of my later take-offs,  which I didn't make because I thought he was going!). Still,  it made be a bit paranoid for the rest of the session. I really  hate it when I drop in on people.  <li> main things to improve: spread feet more (wasn't that bad  today); pump + speed on the board; better awareness of others  (although it's really getting there)  <li> overall a good session though.  <li> 2 dolphins (1 VERY close to me), 1 seal. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> San Onofre, Trail 6, 7:30AM-9:00AM, tide going out (5.4ft at 5:30AM)  <li> with Brad and Christina  <li> knee- to shoulder-high.  <li> ok conditions. had about 15 rides.  <li> Drove up from SD at 5:30 in the morning (55 minute drive)  <li> Brad gave me advice about how to improve, and in particular  how to practice cross-stepping at the end of the ride.  <li> Talked to him about my "losing speed after turns" problem,  and he advises to consciously move my weight forward at the end  of the turn. I am thinking that I could at least bend my ankles.  <li> At first couldn't catch much as the wave there is really slow,  but finally caught up.  <li> got good rides and tried Brad's monster board, on which I  did ok (although turning was a bit challenging).  <li> Some guy would always ditch his board on the take-off as I guess  he would freak because the wave was too steep for him (at San  Onofre????). He did it several time and once he almost hit  Christina as she was paddling out. It was a bit scary.  <li> After the session we went to an organic market to buy vegetables  and we had scrambled eggs with tomatoes and bell pepper at  their place. Then I drove back down for Jim's baby shower and  for Jeff's SuperBowl party.  <li> 1 dolphin between the line-up and the beach. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2004_Feb_8">Sun 8 Feb 2004</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Mission Beach, 11AM-1PM, tide going out (5.5ft at 9:30AM)  <li> Didn't surf for a week because of rain, wind, and Jeff's  gall bladder removal  <li> with Brad and Christina  <li> knee- to shoulder-high, a bit windy  <li> Strong south current, had to paddle constantly  <li> We checked out the surf in the morning (with Travis) a Sunset  Cliffs and at Mission Beach, but the tide was too high. Went  back to my place, Brad and Christina caught some z's while I  went to visit Jeff at the Mercy hospital before going  back to Mission Beach.  <li> Got quite a few rides, but the waves were rather choppy and  difficult to read. Had a few pathetic take-offs on these  bumpy waves. I felt that on some waves my skills were ok and  that one some others they really sucked.  <li> Had one great ride (according to Brad anyway) on which I did  a good turn, and one quite extreme take-off as the tide  going out was starting to make the waves hollower  <li> At some point Brad caught a wave way out, did a couple of  cut-backs, and this guy took off between him and the peak,  way on the inside, while Brad was making a turn rather far off  from the peak. The guy then accelerated and got right behind  Brad, who never saw him, made a cut back, and barely avoided a  collision between the two boards by putting his body in between  them (!). Nevertheless he got a pressure ding on the bottom of  this yellow single-fin that he treasures quite a bit.  The guy  was kind of an asshole about it too, sort of implying that Brad  had dropped on him when in fact Brad was riding the wave a good  8-9 seconds before that guy ever caught it. After that, Christina  got out because she was cold and Brad used her board for 1/2  hour to finish the session. We had a lot of fun during that  1/2 hour and he was able to get the whole thing out of his mind.  <li> Trying to cross-step at the end of rides, but it's so freaking  hard. I can see it will happen at some point though.  <li> Spent some time with Charlie in the patio and then went up to  Baja Don Bravo for burritos </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 6:30AM-8:30PM, tide going out (0.8ft at 10AM)  <li> with Travis, but he went to Ab.  <li> knee-high to waist-high, with 3 head-high sets, at most  4 people in the line up (around 8 at Ab)  <li> overall a mellow session, caught about 20 rides  <li> was on the inside for 2 of the 3 bigger sets, but managed to  catch one of the big ones  <li> Had a few instances in which I was trying to be too aggressive  and too far up on the board and couldn't arch my back enough  to not sink the nose, but overall pretty good take-offs and  rides  <li> still trying the cross-stepping at the end of rides, but it's  still really hard  <li> at the end of my session went to Ab and was alone there with  Travis for 15 minutes. caught three nice lefts. Travis surf  really well on his radical short board, but he's so out of  shape right now he's dying. we laughed about that  <li> 4 dolphins, 1 seal. On a set, I saw the dolphins surf  inside the wave and then jump out about 5ft in the air. It  was amazing. On another wave, a dolphin was surfing right next  to a longboarder. </ul></blockquote>

The first ride  was like a dream.  <li> had about 15 rides  <li> had a very fast left (I don't think I've ever had so much  speed on my board), and a great right with a late take-off  and a high line  <li> messed up a right by going to far down, losing all my speed  at the bottom turn and having it crash on my head. usual  thing. I really need to watch out for that. Waste of a  perfectly good wave.  <li> A few of the paddles were rather grueling, but not like  when it's a big day though  <li> 6 dolphins, saw them surf a wave along with a surfer at  South garbage. One of them jumped about 5ft in the air  and fell on its back. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2004_Feb_15">Sun 15 Feb 2004</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 6:40AM-8:30AM, tide going out (0ft at noon)  <li> with Brad and Christina  <li> waist-high to 1ft overhead, up to 6 people in the line-up  <li> waves really hard to catch because the tide was too high,  and the waves were really bumpy and not clean.  <li> I caught 2 waves, Brad caught 5 and Christina 6, including  the biggest wave she's ever ridden!!  <li> At some point Christina got caught on the inside for about 45  minutes after riding a left! We started getting worried and I  caught a left to go check it out, right after Brad.  She was ok,  just trying to paddle steady without exhausting herself. At  that point I decided to get out, but was myself caught on  the inside and after trying to paddle south I realized that  the current was extremely strong and that getting back to the  little beach from where we paddled in would be really hard. So  I decided to try to get out at the stairs, about 600 yards  north. I started making my way there on land, among rocks, sand,  and chasms. Wasn't easy. Had to put my board high up on rocks,  then climb down into the water, climb back up on the rocks,  and retrieve my board, etc. After 20 minutes I made it to the  stairs. Saw a guy with a broken board.  Once I got up the  stairs I ran with my board all the way up to the parking lot  and back to the little beach (about .5 mile), where I met Brad  and Christina who had decided that I had paddled in. All in  all it wasn't life threatening, and I could always have waited  for the tide to drop more, but it was quite intense.  <li> one dead seal on the rocks by the stairs, with its guts  spilled out. Gave me even more an "end-of-the-world" feeling  at that point. </ul></blockquote>

Occasional decent waves every 10 minutes. Got  about 5 rides, one of them being pretty good. The tide got too  high rather quickly. Roland got a few good ones of course. It  was Krijn's first session and he did ok and tried really hard  on his 7' egg board.  <li> 6 dolphins, pretty close to us, one of them jumped right behind  Krijn </ul></blockquote>

Windy. Choppy. Inconsistent. It  started raining as soon as I got in, but I decided to stay in  to get some surfing done before the rain caused nasty run-offs  for the whole weekend. It sort of felt like the North Sea,  and people started paddling in.  <li> Got 7 rides, one of them good. In fact, on that one I actually  bent my knees more, and sort of felt the board responding.  Bending my knees on the high line, extending them on the  low line. Maybe it's watching all those surf video's in  Dario's room :)  <li> strong north current. Got out of the water about 1/3 mile  north of the house.  <li> 10+ dolphins, surfing the waves, jumping down the face of  the waves, etc. pretty cool.  <li> dead seal on the beach covered with flies </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub, 2:15PM-3:45PM, weird tide, 3ft  <li> by myself. 10 people in the line-up.  <li> really inconsistent wind swell, really difficult to catch  and read waves.  <li> got 3 rides, each of them lefts, pretty sketchy take-offs,  and then not great rides anyway. One was decent.  <li> For 1/2 hour I didn't catch a wave and felt the 0-ride session  coming, and then I caught 3 in 15 minutes.  <li> The rights were much better, but there were 10 kick-ass  short borders right on the reef, so I was on my own further north  trying to catch lefts on bigger sets, which paid off three times.  The shortboarders couldn't really catch many lefts given how  difficult it was to take off. There was no way I could have  competed with them.  <li> I don't like going surfing on week-ends in the afternoon  because of the crowd, but it really was beautiful weather. </ul></blockquote>

His drops were SO clean. We talked to him and he had  lived 15 years in Kauai. Really nice guy. He made the steepest  drops an made them look absolutely easy and natural. amazing.  <li> 6+ dolphins, 2 of them breaching at the same time pretty high </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Mission Beach, 9:20AM-10:30AM, tide going out, (high tide at 8:40AM)  <li> by myself, after spending the night at Charlie's  <li> checked out the surf early in the morning but the tide was too high,  on the other hand, when I surfed later it was windy.  <li> very choppy, waist- to chest-high, windy, inconsistent.  Overall pretty lame conditions, worse than on Sun Feb 8 2004.  <li> mostly nobody with me in the line-up, although there were quite  a few people out. But since the southbound current was quite  strong it seemed that they all kept drifting past me while I was  really busting my ass to stay in front of the house. I figured,  the conditions suck, but at least I'll get a work out.  <li> got about 10 rides, 1 or 2 decent, difficult take offs,  too many bumps on the face of the wave. My main motivation  was to do it for the work out and for the experience as I was  told countless times (Dario, Brad,..) that surfing in crappy  conditions is a good way to improve.  <li> after 1h I had enough. The whole time there was this guy out  who was busting aerial maneuvers one after the other. Completely  insane. That really shows that great surfers can really make the  most of any conditions.  <li> I can't tell if I am improving or not. I _think_ that I am  turning better, or at least making a conscious effort to turn  and be more flexible on the board, etc.. But I am not quite sure  if it is actually happening. Watching tapes of Nat Young and Joel  Tudor in Dario's room is at the same time helpful and depressing.  <li> 1 seal, way on the inside. Popped up about 5 yards from me as I was  riding a wave. Almost fell as I was startled and had to go around  it a bit. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2004_Mar_8">Mon 8 Mar 2004</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub, 6:00AM-7:30AM, tide coming in, (low tide at 4:00AM, -1ft)  <li> by myself  <li> alone in the line-up for 20 minutes, then 3 guys paddled out.  <li> most sets knee- to waist-high, very mellow  <li> had about 25 rides total, all of them really mellow  <li> did my first cross stepping! The first one wasn't even planned  but just came naturally during a ride. pretty weird. The second  was planned. Going backwards I didn't cross step but side  stepped. But at least it's an improvement. I'll really have to  keep at it.  <li> At some point I was paddling out and this guy took off about 20 yards  in front of me. He kept turning left and right and came right at me.  I kept paddling same direction, same speed, and he turned at  the last second, spraying water in my face. It was the weirdest  thing as he had so many opportunities to go around me on both  sides! The vibe was totally mellow out there, the guy had  say "Hi" to me earlier, nobody had been in anybody's line or  had dropped in on people and the waves were knee-high! No clue  what was up with that. Maybe I am reading too much into it.  <li> On my next-to-last wave this older guy was right next to me and  we both paddled for a wave, I couldn't tell if he was going  left or right, and waited until the last possible second  stood up and then saw that he was going to catch it after  all. I managed to bail almost immediately, but he fell on his  take-off. I apologized a bit and he was like: "no worries, I  fucked it up anyway". It was really an unclear situation and  although I didn't keep my eyes off him as I was going for it,  I never could tell whether he was going for it or not. I guess  in doubt I should have bailed right away... oh well. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub, 6:00AM-7:45AM, tide low (low tide at 6:00AM, 0ft)  <li> with Travis  <li> alone with Travis for 20 minutes, then up to 10 people,  and then back down to 4.  <li> most sets at shoulder high, not very consistent but some  nice rights and a few nice lefts. Long spells without waves  or waves so fat only people with 10' massive longboards were  catching them.  <li> Got about 15 rides, including 2 or 3 very good rights that  went forever. Somehow, forgot to practice my cross-stepping.  I keep saying this, but I just need post-it notes on my board  or something.  <li> Still went too low on a couple and lost most of my speed with  the white crashing right behind me. It's just a matter of  remembering to take off at an angle.  <li> right at the end of the session Travis took off on a wave and  I was paddling out about 5-6 yards on the shoulder off from  the break, maybe 5-6 yards further inside than him. Somehow,  his take-off was really off and he lost balance, had his knee on  the board, and when he finally looked up he realized that he was  basically going to ram me over. Had he had a normal take-offs  (like he did all morning catching more than his share of waves),  he would have had plenty of time to go around me, which is what  I was expecting. But instead he just came straight at me and  hit me. It wasn't too bad. His board when over mine, his fins  hit me in the calf and foot. At first I felt there was no damage  done at all, but once on the beach we realized that one of his  fins actually hit my board and made a small, but potentially  harmful ding. There was also a not too good looking ding on  the bottom of his board that he definitely has to fix. We're not  sure how that happened as my board never flipped over. In fact  I hung on to it the whole time. Of course he felt absolutely  horrible, etc. I wasn't too worried about the whole thing  because my board is getting more and more beat-up anyway and  what's one more fix? And also because I could totally have  done something like that. Anyway, that was probably the most  eventful thing of the morning and we joked that, due to this  report, his "ramming speed" behavior was being recorded for  eternity. As he said, in a way it's good he did that to me. Had  it been a local there he would never dare surf there again!  <li> 4+ seals on the outside </ul></blockquote>

Got 11 rides total (yes,  I counted, somehow)  <li> The session started with two lame lefts, and surprisingly  annoying paddles back out. Then for a while I just couldn't  figure out where to be. It seemed there were two peaks, but  sometimes only one, outside, and then inside. It was really  difficult to read the wave and I just picked a spot where I  thought I had seen nice rights break, and waited. After 20  minutes hour I was getting a bit annoyed when I had a great  1/2 hour, with 3 great rights and a few lefts.  <li> This older guy showed up right when I was catching one of my  best lefts. We talked a bit, about conditions yesterday, about  the fact that he had seen a bunch of knee-boarders before,  etc. It's funny, whenever I see an old guy on a long board I  always assume that he's going to be completely ripping with  great style, whereas it turned out that I was much better  than him. I caught quite a few good waves while he was really  struggling.  <li> 3 other guys paddled back out, 2 I had seen before. But that's  right when the conditions starting crapping out. Waves got  smaller, tide higher, waves would break for a bit and then  stop breaking while you were on them. After 20 minutes of that  I paddled in.  <li> Today my take-offs were not good. I had to re-adjust  my feet on the board almost on all of them. Weird. This  had been improving for a while and now I feel that it's  regressing. Maybe I've stopped paying attention... need to  watch out for that. Practiced cross-stepping a bit, getting  a better feel for it, but still long ways to go  <li> On the path met with Randy, that guy I have seen there many  times before and in fact he was there yesterday. Really good  longboarder, white hair and pony tail, about 45-50 years I  would say, really friendly. We talked a bit. I am sure I'll  see him out there soon. Today, he surfed Ab, not subs. He  said that the "locals" at Ab completely rip and know exactly  where to sit. He had trouble competing (if _he_ had trouble,  NO way I am ever going there). </ul></blockquote>

Started to close out at the end of the session.  <li> caught about 20 rides, all of them rights (since the jetty is  to the left). Overall an "ok" session I guess. Dave was stoked because  he is used to crappy and cold NoCal conditions.  <li> Got one _very_ good ride on a head-high wave. Sketchy take-off, but  made it by holding onto the rail and zipped really fast through  the first section. Very long ride too with many cut-backs.  <li> Had a few bad take-offs on which I couldn't make it as the wave  tends to jack up quite a bit.  <li> 2 seals by the jetty </ul></blockquote>

Not  very crowded where we were (5 people), but rather crowded  a bit South where the break's a bit better  <li> Waves were not easy to get into. Got about 10 rides, including  2-3 very good rides with waves that held their shape.  <li> Christina graciously let me go for a nice wave, after which  we had a very long lull without waves. We finally had a small  set coming and we both caught a wave in. My last wave was  a nice left actually, maybe the most nicely shaped wave of  the day.  <li> During this session, somehow, Christina went for the scariest  waves, with really impressive take-offs, but not very good rides  as the wave would literally explode behind her and swallow her in  white water. At the end of one of my nice rides I turned around to  see a rather scary wave about to break. Everybody is paddling for  their life, and before I can say "Holy shit!" Christina just  drops in, zips through the first section and narrowly escapes the  white. She was complaining that she didn't have good wave  selection abilities today, to which I answered: "pu-leaze". </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub, 6:30AM-8AM (low tide at 4:40AM, -0.7ft)  <li> by myself  <li> another session with rather lame conditions. I was alone  for most of the session. Two shortboarders paddled out  towards the end and they were having a really hard time  <li> the type of conditions that make it really hard to surf:  the wave is throwing on the peak, and has virtually no shoulder  off the peak. So either you don't catch it, or it's a very  sketchy take-off for a so-so ride anyway.  <li> Got about 7 rides, and I must say that one of them was rather  excellent. The wave was building up on a real line for once, and  as I took off I decided to to right (it really wasn't clear). I  was pleased with myself because as I took off I realized that the  wave would be sort of a wall and I managed to keep a very high  line to make it. So I just zipped really fast through a long  first section before I could do a cut back. At that point I  realized that 6 months ago I would just have gone straight down,  lost speed, and gotten pummeled.  <li> Toward the end of the session it got windy and that did it,  I managed to catch a wave in. On the walk back to the car I could  see that the conditions were really crapping out and that the two  shortboarders were really not having fun at all. Ab and South  Garbage looked a bit better of course. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 6:15AM-8AM (low tide at 7:30AM, -0.6ft)  <li> by myself.  <li> 5ft-9ft waves. I could tell it was going to be good because I could see  quite a few lines out from the parking lot. The forecast called for bigger  conditions, but, as usual, it was smaller for some definition of smaller.  The  conditions pretty much improved throughout the session and in  fact looked really outstanding at South Garbage at 8:30.  <li> alone for 10 minutes, then 2 guys (one sponger), then little by little  up to 10. All the other spots were totally crowded. Ab was ridiculous with  about 30 people. I checked out Ab from the cliff after my session. 4 guys dropping  on every wave, and the wave at Ab is quite something. I saw at least 2 collisions  (or close) in 5 minutes.  <li> I paddled out alone, and immediately caught two outstanding  rides, one right and one left, both head-high. Got caught in the  inside a couple of times but nothing bad (well, ok, 1 year ago I  would pretty much have died).  <li> Caught about 10 rides total, with 6 or so of them  great. I fell on one steep take-off though. I was kinda pissed because it  was on my 3rd wave and I didn't know what was to come.  <li> When all these people paddled out, I decided to try to score some  lefts as they were all going for the rights. That ended up being  great as only me and that other guy were going for the lefts and  we scored. We started talking. Very nice guy. We talked about the  fact that all those fools would not get the lefts, that surfing's  such a hard sport and that when, like me, you start at 30 years  old, it's a big disadvantage, etc..  As we talked we saw this guy  (I've seen him before there and he is kind of an asshole) take  off basically on this other guys head. There was no way he could  go around him and in fact he should just have passed on that  wave. But he decided to go anyway and basically surfed over the  other guy's board and body! It was unreal and to top it off he  sort of bitched at the other guy for being in his line. This is  the same guy who once yelled at me: "Are you going LEFT or RIGHT?",  when I was on the shoulder on a right-hander, he was to my right, and  there were yards and yards of nasty white on my left. Just trying  to psyche me out of going right by implying that left's even an  option. I had ignored him and gone right. Snaking by intimidation  is his kung-fu.  <li> And then, this set came. First wave is about 7ft I think and the  guy I was talking to catches it (it's a left of course, and it's  only me and him paddling for those). I look at him take off and I  turn back to see this bigger wave setting up. Immediately I  realize I am in the perfect spot. I turn around paddle and make  the drop.  Big fucking drop too. I manage to keep a high line  somehow (good thing I've been able to do that better in the last  2-3 weeks) and pretty much caught the ride of my life (very long  ride too with like 5 cut-backs and extremely fast sections next  to the wall but totally holding).  After that my legs were  shaking, probably due to the adrenaline, fear, excitement,  whatever and I couldn't really surf for 20 minutes as I knew I  couldn't possibly stand up. The guy I was talking to saw my ride  and on the paddle back I said: "WOW...  how big was that do you  think?". And he said: "clean 9ft face, at least.. I saw you take  off and you looked really small out there.  But you did good.  You surfed it casual and your style wasn't bad at all". I  proceeded to hand him a large sum of money.  <li> After that I caught a couple of rides (measly 5ft or so) and  paddled in after the second ride. Needless to say I was pretty  much stoked all the way back to the car and I think I was  grinning the whole time without realizing it because in the  parking lot this guy saw me and said: "it was that good, huh?". I  was like: "ahem... what? yeah...  not as big as the forecast said  though". </ul></blockquote>

Major cross swell (SW and W it seemed)  and on-shore wind that started to blow at 6:15 or so. Extremely  inconsistent, many bumps on all waves, extremely choppy on the  inside, somewhat of a riptide to top it off. And the dreaded  "big wave on the horizon" that just goes up and down and never  breaks cleanly, breaks for 10 yards, then stops breaking, etc.  The only surfable waves had a steep peak and virtually no shoulder  to work on.  Anyway, among the messiest conditions I've surfed at  that spot. Decided to paddle out just for the work out actually.  <li> caught 5 rides, all of them bumpy and thus difficult to stay  on the board, just happy to make the drop. One of the rides (a  left, somehow the rights weren't working at all) was decent I  guess, head-high, pretty long on a very fast wave. I couldn't do  much but go straight and absorb the bumps with my legs. Never had  a chance to do a cutback but at least it was a long ride.  <li> Back in the parking lot, as I was changing amidst a sea  of dogs, a HUGE truck pulled in. Jacked up way high, with exposed  shocks, huge tires, driven by this skanky 20-year old girl. As  she parked I saw this large sticker on the back window (pretty  much covering the entire window, with red letters on a  transparent background) that said: "Chevys are like tampons,  every pussy needs one".

I was to the right of  them and I kept catching mostly rights and they were positioned  for lefts, so I actually never had to pay attention to them on  take-offs. It was weird. Some were ok surfers, better than me, on  shortboards. Some were really lame, paddling with their bodies  way too far back on the boards. But the better surfers among them  never gave them advice. What was weird is that they were all  close together, shouted the whole time, didn't seem very bright,  and would take off all on the same wave, hitting each other with  their boards, etc. That was particularly bad because there were  so may close-outs today.I couldn't figure it out. At some point three  of them took off. One of them literally landed on the second one  and both their boards hit the third one in the head!  He was a  bit knocked out, but then they whooped and paddled back out. It's  terrible to say, but I couldn't help thinking: "Fucking Zonies!".

In fact, I didn't  have too much trouble paddling, sitting  on the board (although I almost tipped over a couple times!), or  catching waves. Everything's harder, but I think that  adapting to this new board will not be such a huge ordeal.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with 4 of them or so really fun. Can't wait  to surf this board in better conditions with less chop. I can already  tell it reacts well under my feet and it's nice to not have to  wonder where to be on the board. It's pretty obvious :) I was  able to work the wave better, and I can see that there's hope of  hitting the lip with that thing. I also was able to make  sketchier take-offs. Overall, I am really looking forward to  surfing this board. Travis is telling me that in 6 months I'll  want a board that under 7'. I am not so sure, but we'll see. </ul></blockquote>

Good thing I didn't take my 7'6'' board though.  <li> After a long part of the session without catching any wave,  Jeff came on the inside at Subs and caught 3 rides (1 of them  with his hands on the board the whole time). It was awesome  though, definitely a good first step. At some point this wave was  forming in front of him and I said: "Dude!", pointing at the  wave. His answer was: "Yeah, I could have gone for that one". I  was stunned because the wave was still forming up and in fact he  was a bit too much on the inside. So I said: "What? DUDE!!!".  Then he realized that he could still get the wave, turned around  and started paddling.  The wave pretty much broke on him (it was  a beyond-late take-off) and he found himself in white, but  eventually stood up and caught his first real ride!

Finally made it back out to the line-up where  I caught 3 rides on 6-7ft waves. One of them was very good, and some  kid in the water was hooting as I was taking off because it was  quite steep. I really had to grab the rail and pull hard on that  one, but then I was able to 2 4-5 cutbacks and the board reacts so  much better than my 9ft. I still need to  get better at positioning my feet on the board. Too close together.  <li> Jeff got caught on the inside a bit North of Subs, and I saw him  get out on the beach. I decided the catch a wave in but that's right  when the conditions really started deteriorating and there was a big  lull with many fake waves that wouldn't break. Eventually I paddled  in right when he was paddling back out to Ab, which was empty. Decided  to go there as well  <li> Ab was smaller and not consistent at all. Only one guy out. I've  rarely seen Ab with nobody there, and it's probably because the  regulars know that it sucks on a South swell. Caught 3 rides there,  with one of them on which I took off with my feet SO close together  that I almost fell. Really need to get a hang of this. Jeff was happy  because he actually stood up twice, while at Sub he had done nothing  but struggle in nasty white water.

From the parking lot it seemed a bit mushy  and the waves looked a bit fat, so I opted to go out with  my longboard.  <li> waist- to head-high+, glassy, but not very consistent. Got caught  on the inside a couple of time, but nothing too bad.  <li> Caught about 10 rides, with 3 of them really good.  <li> On one I did a rather wide bottom turn and almost fell in, but I  put my hand in the water to regain my balance. Ended up surfing it  all the way in.  Also, I was able to kick my board off the back of  the waves before they close out much better, with even a backside  one.  <li> I fell on 3 late take-offs. In fact, one was on my first attempt of  the morning and my immediate though was: "hmmm... should I have taken  my short board out?". But no, the long board was definitely the right  call today as the waves were pretty fat and shortboarders couldn't  catch anything on the outside.  <li> I couldn't catch a wave in and just paddled in. This guy was there  with this black lab (there were about 10 dogs on the beach  running around), and when he started paddling out his dog just  swam behind him. He brought the dog back to the beach. Then he  took off again and his dog waited 5 seconds before following him  in again. I don't think the guy knew what was happening because  the dog paddled out really far until the impact zone at Sub  (maybe 200 yards away). I am not sure how dogs fare in nasty  white water, but I was a bit concerned. Eventually, after being  pounded a couple time, the dog started swimming back to shore. It  took him forever too as he was noticeably slowing down. I still  don't know if the dog just does that every time and his owner's  just chosen to ignore it, or what. It was quite a sad scene I  thought. When the dog got to shore he was completely exhausted and  just plopped down on the wet sand in a completely pathetic heap. </ul></blockquote>

Started paddling out to South of Ab as  there were already 3 people at Ab and I figured that with such lame  conditions there wouldn't be enough waves for all of us. But as I  was paddling it became obvious that those guys were total beginners,  way too far back on their boards, getting up on both knees, etc. So  I decided to go there anyway. Talked to the guys in the water, they  were all pretty nice. One of them though was wearing a 4''3 wetsuit,  thick booties, and gloves. It was odd. None of them could get up  properly on the board, so indeed I had plenty of waves.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, most of them rather lame. I was lucky  enough to ride the only good wave of the day pretty much. It was  very nice left.  <li> Caught a nice left toward the end as it seemed that bigger sets were  coming in. Overall a surprisingly enjoyable session given the outlook  from the parking lot when I showed up. I feel that I really made the  most of it. </ul></blockquote>

I then paddled back to Ab,  caught one nice wave on the way, and then a couple more.  <li> Pretty happy that I didn't fall once, meaning that many I am getting  more used to the board.  <li> Travis was really doing nice backside turns today. Some guy dropped  in on him early on and we now all hate him.  <li> One the last wave both Travis and I dropped on that wave (I dropped in  on him in an attempt to both catch the same wave out) but I  totally ate it.  <li> 1 seal 10ft from me at New Break </ul></blockquote>

I am starting to believe that  this place doesn't work on a low tide. Somehow it got bigger  throughout the session and the little reef we were at made the  waves jack up quite a bit. But many waves didn't really have a face  and this session still ranks as one of the worst condition-wise.  <li> As the tide was getting lower we started becoming a bit weary of  the rocks at the bottom. In fact, at some point I was sitting on  my board and when I tried to turn my fin hit the bottom! We  started trying to be very careful about where we would try to  take off, etc.  <li> Still, I guess it was decent practice for me on my 7'6'' and I really  focused on trying to stay low.  <li> After the session, as we walked on the beach, we noticed that there  were a bunch of (dead) sea animals trapped in kelp. Tons of lobsters  that had clearly been eaten by something, a beached sand shark, crabs,  sea anemone, tons of sea shells, jellyfish, etc. As Travis said, it  was better than any tide pool he's been to. </ul></blockquote>

As the tide dropped the reef started to close out,  the waves had less of a face, and it started looking like yesterday.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, 5 of them great, 5 of them pitiful due to my  lack of skill on this board. It seems that I had a great  beginning of the session, then a horrible spell of bad take-offs,  and then again a pretty decent phase. In particular I wasted two  great waves because I tried to take off on the peak and just  couldn't stand up due to the speed. This brought me back to about  2 years ago when I started getting better on my long board. But I  can tell I am improving.  <li> Charles did much better in terms of sitting on the board and he  actually stood up for .1 second in the white of a big wave. </ul></blockquote>

The swell was knee- to chest-high, with occasional shoulder-high  sets. It was very organized and glassy, but not very consistent on  the outside with long lulls in between sets. The inside on the  other hand was surprisingly fun. Rides were not as long, but  take-offs were good.  <li> Caught about 15 rides. 2 of them on the outside on bigger waves, but  most of them on the inside. It was amazing that every one was staying  on the outside while I was surfing wave after wave by myself. At some  point I caught 8 waves in a row, each of them beautiful and so glassy  I was blinded by the reflection of the sun on the wave.  <li> It's so easy riding a long board now. Take-offs were no sweat even when  I was a bit late. I cross-stepped a bit forward and backward.

So I was always almost pearling, and then arching back and  stepping on the tail on the take-off. Good practice I guess. Did  one very good turn, probably the most stylish I've done.

He was tired, but caught a couple of decent rides. After the  session we ended up discussing the notion that he wasn't peeing  in his wetsuit.

The wave was so glassy that I could  see his reflection in it as we were both riding! I kept making small  sections and getting around the white back to the front of the wave  where he was cross-stepping like crazy. It was a completely magical  moment and we both bailed out of that wave right at the beach going  "Duuuuuuuuude, that was such a nice wave!!!!". It was only waist-high  but really perfect.

It was difficult for me to stand up actually because  it was so painful during take-off. I am wondering if it's not due  to my new (and better) paddling technique.

Also, I was dominating the line-up  completely in terms of positioning, wave selection, and paddling  power.

This guy took off on a wave. I could see right away  that he didn't quite know what he was doing, although he was  able to stand up in the white water on his 8' egg. He was coming  towards me, we made eye contact, and for some reason he kept going  without turning.  I couldn't believe it. Finally, when I knew for  sure we'd have a collision, he jumped off, letting his board go,  which jumped up out of the white maybe 2 feet from me. I  was so mesmerized by the stupidity of it all that I was  reactionless. He got up and looked at me sheepishly. I just  stared at him for 2 seconds, totally pissed, and paddled back out  as fast and powerfully as I could. It must have taken me 10  seconds to get back in the line-up, and within 5 seconds I was  catching my last wave in. A pretty good ride actually. Right then  I realized that I am becoming like all those surfers who can't  stand beginners, arguably because they do beginner mistakes that could  potentially be dangerous, but who I used to think were just  assholes.

I met Ken in the parking lot  who decided not to paddle out, but I did anyway just for the  exercise. And from the parking lot it seems that Ab would come through  every now and then  <li> Caught about 15 rides total, with 3-4 of them actually decent. I  feel that there weren't that many waves to catch this morning,  and I managed to quite a few of the better ones I think. That was  because I've been paddling better lately, and of course going  from the 7'6'' to the 9' made me feel like I could catch pretty  much anything.  <li> Managed to do some passable cross-stepping on some of the rides,  but nothing too exciting.  <li> Just when I was ready to catch my last wave in as the tide was  getting too high, I managed to catch this wave that was maybe  waist-high (there were 3 others guys going for it but it seemed  that they just couldn't position themselves well ever, but  it's true that the wave at Ab is a bit difficult to read when  you've never been there as there are sort of two peaks who  sometimes connect and sometimes do not). I was looking at the  beach and at the last second, as I was making a slow turn around  the knee-boarder, I saw this patch of kelp that I couldn't avoid.  I fell after my fin got caught and I decided to try to catch a  last wave because this one didn't count. After 20 minutes, no  rideable wave had come, and I had to paddle in anyway. That guy  on a 7'5'' board or so paddled out maybe 20 minutes before I got  out, couldn't catch a wave and paddled in right after me. Pretty  sad session for him. </ul></blockquote>

On Charle's  7'8'' for a while, and then back on the 9' for 2 waves.  <li> knee- to waist-high, with a few chest-high waves coming through,  inconsistent for 45 minutes, consistent for 30 minutes, and back to  being inconsistent, glassy, no wind, a bit mixed up with quite a  few doubles. Most waves were closing out on the inside.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, most of them towards the end. About 5 of  them were good, and one was outstanding. I caught that chest-high  left-hander, although there were almost only rights today. There were  quite a few so-so longboarders there, older, and I could tell that  they were totally jealous of me catching that wave. Definitely the  wave of the day. There were better waves at the main peak, but the  crowd was definitely a turn-off.  <li> I think I did the longest and hardest paddle I've ever done to catch  a wave today. It was completely ridiculous. From the look of it I'd say  that I paddled easily 40 yards before getting up, did one turn, and  that was the end of the ride. Charles said he was in utter disbelief  and just kept seeing my legs until I stood up completely on the  inside. I don't know, trying to do this and catch unlikely waves  is sort of becoming a fun paddling challenge.  That one was  outrageous though. There were two guys on the inside who looked at  me all the way and probably thought I was utterly insane.  <li> Towards the end of the session I caught that one wave that lined up  pretty well and it was barely closing out. As I got to the inside  I saw that shortboarder standing there and he was right in my line.  I felt like I could keep edging on the shoulder although it was  closing out. I ended up falling right after passing him. I really  thought I was going to make it. I think the board had something to  do with it actually. Anyway, no harm done, and he was really nice  about it. After I apologized and said I really thought I was  going to make it, he just said that it wasn't a big deal and that  there is just so far down the line you can go until you wipe out on  the inside. It was a great ride though.  <li> I tried Charles' board at the end. Definitely not easy to paddle  on. It's a 7'8'' but it doesn't paddle as well as my 7'6'' and feels  more like a shortboard. I caught two nice waves with it though, and  it felt very light under my feet.  <li> We swapped boards again and I caught a wave maybe 2 seconds after  putting the leash on. I always like doing that.  <li> Charles is getting better, although he can't quite stand up on the  take-offs yet. He was actually better on the 9' which is much more  stable than his 7'8''. The good thing is that he is absolutely  fearless. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Ab, 9AM-11AM (high tide at 9AM, 4.5ft)  <li> by myself, 10+ people out  <li> On my 9ft  <li> The surf at Mission Beach in the morning was lame, closing out on  bigger sets, and mushy on smaller ones. After talking to Dario on  the phone I decided to check out the Cliffs and to go get my green  card photos taken in case it wasn't good. From the parking lot I  saw a nice set break at Ab. I was surprised because I thought the  tide would be way too high. Turns out that there were indeed nice  sets coming at the waist-high range, with a couple of them at  chest-high. Very glassy, long lulls in between sets, with a good  half hour in the middle of the session.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with 5 of them pretty good. The session  started amazingly. After paddling out in the middle of all these  people I got 5 rides in a row, while nobody else got any wave, and  my hair was still dry. At some point I've got to accept the fact  that I have improved. There were 3 guys out there who were good,  looking way better than me on the wave, much better surfers, but I  would catch more waves than them. At some point, if I manage to get  some style, I should become decent.  <li> I caught maybe the biggest wave of the day. I was alone on the  outside somehow, and was perfectly placed. Rode it to the end,  with 2 good turns, cross-stepping close to the nose, then  cross-stepping back (that's rare for me), and turning the board  around paddling out after a smooth exit. That was probably a high  point of my surfing over the last month.  <li> I felt a bit bad for all the beginner on the inside. I was sort  of in the zone and I was paddling like a complete maniac on the  outside, ending up catching most waves. But nobody dropped on me.  I  also starting dropping in on them when there was a fair distance  between them and me, and then checking to see if they were  standing. 9 times out of 10 they had fallen and I had a wave. 1  time out of 10 I would race down the line and pull out. I think  they were looking at me like I was some kind of maniac. The thing is,  on sessions like these, I just feel like getting a work out and  paddling for everything that moves. It used to be that I would  never be well positioned and have to pull out to let people go  or just not catch the wave, but now I am decently positioned and  I typically catch the wave. Oh well. Too bad for them. They were  all longboarders too. Had they been shortboarders I wouldn't have  done that at all.  <li> One of the guys who paddled out yelled at his friend out in the  line-up. "Hey Bro!!! I Totally watched Fast Times last night! I am  line in total Spicoli mode... Gnarly!!!". Pretty funny.  <li> There was a guy out there who looked terrified, although the  conditions were as unscary as they can be at Ab, but if  you're a complete beginner, going to Ab is probably not the best  choice, even on a mellow day. Anyway, he stayed on the inside,  WAY far in where the waves can't break. Then his friends called  him to the line-up. He paddled out a bit and I could tell he had  some type of 6'10 tri-fin. He was terrified of the waves but  didn't really get in people's way at all, which was good. Anyway,  as I paddled back in, I saw him on the little beach, sitting and  looking quite forlorn. His board was turned upside down, and I  saw this huge fish drawing on the bottom. For 1 second I  thought maybe it was because the board was a "fish", but it  wasn't a fish. And then it hit me it was just a very large,  hand-drawn, christian fish! The guy was probably from the Point  Loma Nazarene University up the cliff, and was surfing for Jesus,  or rather was getting the fear of God put into him by knee-high  waves.  Then I realized something else. He and his friends at some  point made a circle in the water beyond the line-up, holding hands  for about 20 minutes (missing the best waves actually as 3 good  sets came in). I didn't know what the hell was going on, but now  it is clear that they were actually praying. And I know that  two of them were from the Nazarene university as they talked  about it. I am going out there tomorrow morning to see what they do  on a Sunday. But I've got to say, they were all nice and didn't  drop in on me once as I caught every single wave out there :) </ul></blockquote>

Hard to get  into the waves because of the tide, but some lined up really well  and were really fun.  <li> Had about 10 rides, with 3 of them great.

On  another I had so much water in my eyes that I couldn't get up until  I was almost at the bottom of the wave and I ended up surfing the  reform.  <li> Between the tide, the backwash, and the wind, the inside was bumpy  and I didn't even try to cross-step once. On the earlier sections  it was all about gaining speed and making it. I was able to make  several cool maneuvers though.  <li> It was a very friendly atmosphere in the line up with the 3 other guys  and we talked and joked around quite a bit.

Definitely more organized than yesterday with  clean lines coming in. The tide was too high though and most of  the waves were very difficult to get into.  <li> Given that the tide was high I hesitating between my 9' and my 7'6''  in the morning, but I thought that the swell would be strong (based  on yesterday session and on the forecast) and only took my 7'6''. In  retrospect I should have gotten my 9' as the swell wasn't as  strong as yesterday; but I still caught a few good rides. I was  talking out there and in the parking lot with guys who, like me,  had taken out their mid-range 7'-8' boards and were saying they  wished they had taken their longboards. But I am still happy I  took the 7'6'' as it's more of a work out and good practice for  things to come.  <li> Caught maybe 15 rides, with 2 or 3 good ones, and the rest just  average and mushing out on the inside. I messed up 2 very good  waves. On the first one I have no idea what happened. My board just  sort of fell under me as I pushed on it to get up and I had to push  again, but at that point I was at the bottom of the wave. I managed  to get up but I had missed the better part of the  wave. On another one I just want straight down without turning.  That hadn't happened to me in a while. The problem was that waves  today had quite a bit of texture and there were several bumps on  the way down the face, which threw me off.  <li> On a few rides I actually managed to do a few sharp turns. Still  far from doing great things, but I can tell it's coming, one  epsilon at a time.  <li> One of the guys out was this older guy who was frighteningly  nice, pointing out waves to me, talking, helping me out get up  the cliff at the end as it was extremely slick with water on  clay, etc.  We talked a bit in the parking lot. Lately it seems  that with the winter coming there are fewer people out and the  vibe is much more friendly. Also, with the swell getting bigger,  it's actually quite a paddle back to the line-up and even when  there are 5 guys out, there is little competition for waves as 3  of those guys are on their way back to the line-up.  <li> First session with a long suit, which was definitely the right choice. </ul></blockquote>

Occasional waves  above waist-high.  <li> Caught about 10 rides, none of them good. Did a few ungraceful  pull-outs of close outs.  <li> It was Eddy's first session ever, which was the main motivation  for paddling out. He did ok, and of course was amazed at how hard this  whole surfing thing is physically.  <li> We ended the session pretty much in the dark. It was good that we  were to put in a session before sunset, which wasn't a given given  that traffic was really not good and for a moment I thought we  wouldn't have any time to surf </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Ab, 6:45AM-7:45AM (high tide at 9:20AM, 5.9ft)  <li> with Dave Doolin  <li> On my 9'  <li> knee- to waist-high, not very consistent but a few sets coming through,  almost glassy at first, then mixed up toward the end of the session  <li> Dave and I had been trying to go surfing Sunset Cliffs for a while  as he'd never been there. We sort of knew the swell would be lame  and the tide too high, but decided to go anyway. Turned out better  than what it looked like in the parking lot.  <li> Caught about 10 rides, with 3-4 of them quite fun and long although  the wave didn't have much power. Of course one had to paddle like  crazy to get into the wave.  <li> Dave caught a few nice ones and, although today wasn't really what  Ab's all about, he could tell the potential of the place.  <li> Overall a nice session, mellow, and we felt like we made the most out  of the morning given the bad tide and the absence of a real swell. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Mission Beach, 7:30AM-8:45AM (high tide at 10:46AM, 6.39ft)  <li> with Eddy, met Roland in the line-up and a friend of his later  <li> on my 9'  <li> knee- to waist-high, inconsistent, choppy and windy, many close-outs,  but still a few rides to be had  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with only 2 of them good. On my last wave  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Roland drop in on me. I  yelled: "Oh my God!!" (jokingly) and he pulled out of the wave. I  was able to ride it all the way in although I had been forced to  make a cutback to avoid Roland and wasn't as far down the line as  I wanted. I did a little bit of cross-stepping and got to the  beach. Pretty hilarious. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Turn-about, 6:15AM-7:30AM (high tide at 10AM, 5.75ft)  <li> by myself, 3-4 people in the line-up  <li> on my 9'  <li> waist-high, with a few chest-high sets. Not very consistent. I  went up North county because of the horrible sewage spill at  Point Loma. The tide was too high though and the conditions  decayed as the session went on. A bit windy. Quite a bit of  backwash.  <li> Caught maybe 10 rides, with 2-3 of them decent, 1 on a chest-high  waves. The rides weren't smooth due to texture and backwash. I was  sort of pleased that I managed to bend my knees enough to absorb  most bumps. Waves got increasingly difficult to get into and I  couldn't believe that there were people paddling out when I got  out. My last wave was a pretty decent left that brought me right  to the beach. I had started the session North of the beach, and  finished South, just because I was paddling around.  <li> I was completely out of shape. After 2 weeks without surfing, and  one of those weeks spent in bed with a fever and a cold, I felt  really, really weak. But I still managed to paddle enough to  catch a bit more waves than most people there. Not the ideal  conditions to get back to surfing though as I really needed to be  in my best paddling shape. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub and then Ab,  3:45PM-4:30PM (high tide at 3PM, 4.1ft)  <li> by myself, 10+ people out in the line-up  <li> on my 9'  <li> chest-high with a few head-high sets, quite a bit of texture on  the water, not consistent, tide a bit too high, but nice rides to  be had  <li> 4 rides total with long waits in between them. Still not feeling in very  good shape after my flu and my horrible root canal that've kept me at home  for the most part of the last two weeks.  <li> Not a great session for me. I started at Sub, with 10+ shortboarders on  the inside. On my first ride, a right, I tried to go around that guy, but  I fell on the turn and could've hit him with my board. It was totally my  fault and it's true that I am not used to take-off with so many people  in the inside.  <li> After that I paddled out to Ab. There I was on the outside, with perhaps  6 people on the inside, a mix of shortboarders and longboarders. My first  ride was on a right, which is never great at Ab. It mushed out on the  inside. On my second ride the wave was head-high and I was a bit too much  on the inside. Plus, I had to take off straight to avoid somebody on the  inside. I ended up taking up steep and straight, made it, and then managed  to catch up with the shoulder. In retrospect a better surfer could probably  have pulled a totally wide and classy bottom turn.  <li> My third ride was again on a head-high wave. There were two guys closer  to the peak and until the last second I couldn't tell whether they were  going to make it. They ended up not making it (I can't figure out  why). Perhaps they let me go because I started paddling way far  on the outside compared to them. Anyway, I made the drop on my  stomach because I was trying not to drop in on them. Managed to  stand up late and ride to wave all the way to the inside. I felt a bit bad  because I was the one getting the last two rideable waves, so maybe I should  not have paddled for that last one. whatever.  <li> Stunning sunset. It was great to be out in the water. The normal path to  go to the beach was closed due to "unstable cliffs". Probably because of the  heavy rain. So now one has to go through or completely around the ballpark. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub,  12PM-2PM (low tide at 4:52PM, -1.3ft)  <li> by myself, from 15 to 40 people in the line-up  <li> on my 9'  <li> waist-high to chest-high with a few head-high sets, a little bit choppy,  not consistent at all, many waves not breaking due to the tide still being  rather high (the high was at 7.3ft).  <li> I showed up at Mission Beach at 11:30 with groceries for Charlie, and met  Roland who told me that it had been closing out all day, with literally no corners  at all. We discussed the fact that the Cliffs would be good but crowded. The swell  looked big in Mission Beach and indeed completely closed out, so I decided to drive  to the Cliffs on the spot (after dropping off Charlie and a few heavy plants at a  neighbor's). I figured that the tide would still be high and that the crowd would  therefore not be too outrageous. And besides, I am just back from  Pittsburgh, off to Venezuela in 4 days, followed by Seattle, so  this was sort of my last chance to get wet for a while.  <li> When I got to the parking lot it was indeed crowded and I had to  sort of create my own spot. There were about 20 people at  Garbage, 30 at Ab, and 10 at Sub. I opted for Sub as I felt it  wouldn't get as crowded. The problem was that the tide was too  high and waves were very rarely catchable on the outside. I  stayed there for about 45 minutes and had only one opportunity on  a head-high wave, which I screwed up by being too far back on the  board. Only a few people caught waves in those 45 minutes.  <li> After that I went to the inside. It still wasn't consistent but I  was able to catch 4 rides, with 2 of them pretty fun although a bit short. I couldn't catch a wave in and after trying for 20 minutes I paddled in on some white.  <li> By the time I got out there were 70+ people at Ab, 40+ at Sub,  there was a constant  stream of surfers coming down the cliff and there was literally a  traffic jam to get back up the cliff, and the parking lot was a  complete mess with people parked everywhere. A guy waited for my  spot the whole time I was changing, putting my board on the roof  of the car, etc.  I think I am swearing off going to the Cliffs  unless it's 6AM, and when the tide's high in the morning I'll  just go surf elsewhere.  It's just too much of a zoo, especially  on a Sunday. I can't imagine what it's going to be like at 4PM  when the tide is best! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub,  6:15AM-7:45AM (low tide at 6AM, 2.5ft)  <li> by myself, met Sylvia in the line-up, 5-6 people out.  <li> on my 7'6''  <li> waist-high to chest-high with a few head-high sets, glassy, not  very consistent  <li> A big swell is supposed to hit California, and I decided to go for one  session after one month without surfing due to my crazy travel schedule,  especially since I am flying out to Europe tomorrow.  It turned  out to be much smaller than I expected and I sort of  wished I had taken  my 9' since the tide was a bit high too. Sylvia was talking about how  much bigger it was yesterday, and everybody was talking about how  huge it was going to be this weekend.  <li> There were quite a few lulls in between sets. Ab, as usual, was  working better, with better size and a bit more consistency, but  was crowded with 15+ people. I saw quite a few outrageous snakings  over there.  <li> Caught about 8 rides, all of them but one of waist- to chest-high  waves.  I caught one ride on a 6 footer, a right, which was pretty good,  although I didn't get as much speed as I wanted from the board.  But overall, it was great to be in the water. Beautiful morning  too, with not one cloud in the sky.  <li> The size increased a bit throughout the session, probably foreshadowing  the big swell that's coming.  <li> There was a knee-boarder in the line-up with us, and he was  completely ripping. </ul></blockquote>
