 <li> Flies, 10:30AM-12PM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash  <li> By myself. Nobody out at first, and then Eric showed up.  <li> Waist-high, smooth, really inconsistent with 15-min lulls.  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with only one good one with a decent wall.  <li> Was great being back in the water, and great seeing Eric after  such a long time! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2017_Jan_14">Sat 14 Jan 2017</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 9:30AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. Up to 3 other people out, alone for a bit.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, inconsistent, oddly angled, tide a bit  too high as expected, glassy.  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with one really good right. There were a  few bigger sets coming through but they either broke outside or  were closing out.  <li> Saw Eric and Tracy out in the parking lot after the session, as  they were getting to go out, thus benefiting from a lower tide  but with more wind. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8AM-9:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, nobody out (bumped into Wendell and another guy as they  were getting out of the water).  <li> Waist-high, very inconsistent, a bit bumpy due to the Kona winds.  <li> Caught 6 waves, nothing special.  <li> Very out of shape of course after 2 months out of the water! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2017_Mar_28">Tue 28 Mar 2017</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, nobody out for about 1 hour, and then only Carl out.  <li> waist-high+, inconsistent and sort of mixed up with many doubles.  <li> Caught 5 waves only, but each of them pretty nice, walling up  no the inside. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2017_Mar_30">Thu 30 Mar 2017</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 9AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, Carl and Eric out for the first 1/2 hour, then about 1/2  hour by myself, and later Jim and Conrad.  <li> waist-high+, not very consistent, especially at the end, quite messy, light winds getting stronger as the session went on.  <li> Caught 10+ waves, with 2 or 3 really nice rights halfway through the  session. The last 1/2 hour was blown out and I caught a tiny insider  back to shore. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2017_Mar_31">Fri 31 Mar 2017</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 9AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, nobody out.  <li> waist-high+, not very consistent, moderate winds, pretty decent  sets coming through.  <li> Caught 7-8 waves with a couple of good ones.  <li> Met Jay who was getting out of the water as I was getting in. Somebody  had ripped off his backpack that he typically leaves on the  rocks. From the line-up I saw him walk up and down the shore  talking to some of the homeless that have established camp there,  and amazingly at some point I saw him with his backpack back in  his possession! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2017_May_20">Sat 20 May 2017</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 9AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'2'' Morgan  <li> By myself, up to 20 people out.  <li> waist- to chest-high, with a few head-high close out sets,  moderate winds, not consistent, getting worse as winds  (sea breezes) and tide picked up.  <li> Caught 3 waves, nothing great.  <li> Obviously in terrible paddling shape after 2 months  without surfing due to lack of waves, being sick, and  being overworked. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2017_May_22">Mon 22 May 2017</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' (which is at the end of its life I am afraid)  <li> By myself for most of the session, and then a "kayaker" out  at the end  <li> waist- to chest-high, not consistent but a few sets, light to  moderate winds  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with a couple of decent one including the last  one after which I decided to call it a day; flying off to Europe  for 2 months tomorrow, next session will be in San Diego! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2017_Aug_1">Tue 1 Aug 2017</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 4:30PM-5:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself and alone out there  <li> Knee-high, inconsistent and weak  <li> Just a "get-back-in-the-water" session while Serge and his mom were  taking a walk on the shore to Point Panic. Still did a fair amount  of paddling and caught 4 "waves", thus slowly getting back into shape. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 7AM-8:30AM  <li> On my 9'2''  <li> By myself, up to 6-7 other people out  <li> Waist-high, really inconsistent for the first hour, and then  a bit better  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, with only 2 real waves. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2017_Dec_18">Mon 18 Dec 2017</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Diamond Head, 8:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, up to 25 people out on the peak  <li> Waist-high, glassy, somewhat consistent  <li> After not surfing for months, not working out for months, and being  constantly either sick or overworked, I took it easy and stayed on the  inside of the main peak.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, all pretty smooth if small.  <li> Good way to attempt again to get back into surfing. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Rockpiles, 11:30AM-1PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, up to 25 people out on the peak  <li> Waist-high, glassy, pretty consistent  <li> After checking Flies (which was flat, and closed to the public!),  went to Rockpile for a mellow birthday session  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with a couple of decent rights that  lined up ok. On quite a few waves my line was impeded by people  paddling out as the spot got more and more crowded, but no biggie.  <li> In terrible shape, as expected </ul></blockquote>
