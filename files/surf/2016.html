 <li> Diamond Head, 9AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'2'' Stewart  <li> With Nodari, 5+ people out.  <li> Waist-high, choppy, really windy and disorganized.  <li> Caught 4-5 "waves", huge workout to stay in position (we ended up going back in  by the footpath after drifting quite a bit). Pretty intense "let's get  back in the water" session. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_Jan_7">Thu 7 Jan 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Diamond Head, 2PM-3PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, 20+ people out  <li> Waist- to chest-high, smooth, no winds, pretty consistent if a bit weak.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, include 4 really nice rights, even though today was a day  of weaving around people on the inside due to the crowd. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_Jan_24">Sun 24 Jan 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 9AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, met Eric and Tracy in the parking lot. A couple of  guys on the Ewa side of the spot.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, somewhat consistent and clean, very light winds.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple very good ones. Amazing that  nobody was out with such decent waves.  <li> After one wave I got caught inside, had to turtle, and somehow pulled  something in my right shoulder as the wave went over me. Had to stop  the session after that. Sort of worried I may be out of commission for  a while. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_Mar_7">Mon 7 Mar 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 7:30AM-8:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, nobody out.  <li> Waist-high+, not consistent, very glassy.  <li> First time out after hurting my shoulder and it's not 100% yet even  after more than one month.  <li> Caught 3 waves, nothing to write hoe about but not bad.  <li> Shoulder was "ok". Definitely fine for normal movement, but oddly painful  for odd twisting motions that have nothing to do with surfing. We'll see. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_Mar_19">Sat 19 Mar 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'2''  <li> With Jason (on my 9'6''), 1-2 other people out  <li> Waist-high, not consistent at all, light winds.  <li> Took out Jason for this 3rd session ever. Just wanted to get in the  water and see how the shoulder held up.  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with only one real wave. Slim pickings today, but the shoulder was pretty good, so that's good news. Not 100%, but close. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_Mar_21">Mon 21 Mar 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Diamond Head, 1:30PM-3PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. About 15-20 people out. Met Spencer and his roommates in the  water!!  <li> Waist-high+, not very consistent, glassy at the beginning of the session  but a bit bumpy toward the end.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with one decent right in the middle of the session  and a pretty good chest-high last wave that brought be almost all the  way in.  <li> Should felt pretty good, better than last time. Only when I paddled  very hard for a small insider did it bother me a little bit. Hopefully  I can use Spring Break week to get back into shape. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, 1PM-2PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. About 20 people out.  <li> Waist-high+, a bit bumpy, not very consistent, but occasional nice waves  coming through.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with one outstanding right (given the conditions)  that had a beautiful wall on the verge of closing out all the way to the  inside. Caught a couple of other nice ones too.  <li> Overall a pretty nice session also I missed the glassiness from two  days ago. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, 9AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. About 30 people out.  <li> Waist-high+, light winds, not very consistent.  <li> Caught about 8 waves, with 2 outstanding rights that were in the  chest-high range, and that somehow came my way while I was on the outside.  One of them in particular was perfectly lined-up with a super nice wall. I  really had to scratch to get into that one but it was worth it. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_Mar_27">Sun 27 Mar 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Old Man's, 10AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> By myself. 6-7 SUPers out, one longboarder.  <li> Waist-high, very weak and inconsistent.  <li> Caught 2 waves, one of them being halfway decent.  <li> Just paddled out for the exercise since I was at Kaimana  anyway. Conditions were great for SUPs but really marginal  on a longboard. Beautiful weather and amazingly clear water! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Old Man's, 10AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. About 10 people out, half of them 4 SUPers.  <li> Waist-high, very inconsistent and weird.  <li> Caught 4 waves, with only one decent one. Really difficult  to read the waves today, felt very high-tidish even though  it was only midtide. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_Apr_22">Fri 22 Apr 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 9AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Fabrice (on my Stewart) and later Nodari. 4-5 people out  including Eric. Saw Tracy getting out of the water as we were  getting in.  <li> Very inconsistent with long lulls and a few big waves coming  every 30 minutes.  <li> Caught 2-3 non-waves on the inside.  <li> It was Fabrice's first session and he did pretty well overall,  even though at the end of this rather long session he started  feeling a tad tired. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_Apr_29">Fri 29 Apr 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 12:15PM-2PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Nobody out.  <li> waist-high, windy, choppy, ugly, inconsistent, but sunny.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, with only one real ride (last one).  <li> Went out there on whim just to get wet, after being overworked for  a month. Totally worth it in spite of bad conditions. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_May_1">Sun 1 May 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6:30AM-8:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Up to 12 people out including Garry and Jay.  <li> waist-high+, light winds, inconsistent.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with 2 really good ones, including  my last wave, with a nice wall all the way to the inside.  Otherwise, a pretty unimpressive session with quite a few  people out due to the forecast.  <li> Weirdly, two guys got in the water by climbing down the rocks of the  jetty instead of going down the stairs.... </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2016_May_2">Mon 2 May 2016</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6:45AM-8:15AM  <li> On my 9'2''.  <li> By myself. 4 other people out.  <li> Waist-high+, really inconsistent, light winds.  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with only one decent right.  <li> Although the forecast said the swell would be up, instead  it died overnight. It was pretty sad out there with waves  not forming in spite of the super low tide. Only a few sets  came through and of course it was hard being in position.  <li> Probably overdid it a bit this weekend. My left forearm was  pretty sore this morning. Getting old sucks. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Rich and Nodari. 2-3 people out initially, including Patrick.  <li> Waist-high, consistent-ish, getting choppier and windier as the session  went on.  <li> Caught something like 25 waves, with 3-4 really good rights that  stayed nicely open and had a wall to work with. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:15AM-10:15AM  <li> On my 9'2''.  <li> By myself, 8 other people out including Jay, Conrad, Greg, Rob.  <li> Shoulder-high+, sort of consistent but a few lines that wouldn't break,  moderate to strong winds.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a few good rights. In particular, I had one  screaming right that was perfectly lined up, at the edge of closing out but  staying open. Took a very high line and was essentially on the lip the whole  time. Greg inside called it "the ride of the day" :) </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 7:30AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> With Nodari, nobody out for most of the session, one guy out at the  end.  <li> waist-high to occ. shoulder-high, light winds, consistent-ish but  a bit odd. The tide switch really changed the conditions, with waves  being much bigger/fatter, with a few head-high peaks. Really strange.  <li> Caught 20+ waves, with 4 or 5 really nice rights. Lost my board  only once after taking off on a big and bumpy set and having it explode  on me after the first section.  <li> Overall a pretty nice session, concluded with a last wave that  was lined up all the way to the inside. </ul></blockquote>

Finally getting  back in some sort of surfing shape. </ul></blockquote>

I guess it was still good  to get in the water to paddle. And yes, I knew Flies wouldn't  be a good choice, but I didn't expect it to be this bad. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 7AM-8:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, nobody out  <li> Waist-high, pretty inconsistent but some sets making it  through, no wind.  <li> Caught 6 waves, with a couple of surprisingly fun ones  considering the weak conditions. Tide was going low, and still  many sets didn't break.  <li> Nothing beats being all alone like that in the morning with beautiful  weather, and each wave felt like a bonus.  <li> On the way back on the stairs, I saw that the kids who were there  as I got into the water with their mom had left trash everywhere,  including an empty back of Cheetos with several cheetos on the stairs  being eaten and dragged away by crabs. I picked up all the trash and  threw it in the trash can not 20 feet from the stairs. The kids and  their mom were on the boardwalk at that point, and they  looked at me like I was some insane person.... sigh... </ul></blockquote>
