 <li> Flies, 9AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Fabrice (on my Stewart) and later Nodari. 4-5 people out  including Eric. Saw Tracy getting out of the water as we were  getting in.  <li> Very inconsistent with long lulls and a few big waves coming  every 30 minutes.  <li> Caught 2-3 non-waves on the inside.  <li> It was Fabrice's first session and he did pretty well overall,  even though at the end of this rather long session he started  feeling a tad tired. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 12:15PM-2PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Nobody out.  <li> waist-high, windy, choppy, ugly, inconsistent, but sunny.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, with only one real ride (last one).  <li> Went out there on whim just to get wet, after being overworked for  a month. Totally worth it in spite of bad conditions. </ul></blockquote>
