 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Ab,  6:45AM-8AM (low tide at 7AM, 1.5ft)  <li> by myself, no one out at any of the spots around there  <li> on my 9'  <li> knee- to thigh-high, rather long lulls between sets, off-shore  breeze that generated quite a bit of texture on the water but  improved the wave shape.  <li> I just had to get out in the water after surfing only once in the  last two months due to traveling and bad weather. I figured that  after 4 days since the last rainfall the water should be  reasonably safe. In spite of the weak swell I opted for the Cliffs  because it's so beautiful there, because I wanted to see how much  damage the torrential rainfall had caused, and because  I figured I may be alone in the water.  <li> The fact that it was windy was a bit of a bummer, but the Cliffs  were absolutely beautiful. I've never seen them so green before,  the weather was utterly clear, with the sun coming out halfway  through the session. The rain hasn't caused much damage at all,  in part due to sand bags and cinder blocks probably put there  by the city.  <li> Caught 10 rides, with 5-6 of them on decent waves. Mushy at the  end, but made a few turns. Was able to cross-step forward and  backward on a couple of rides too. All-in-all a good "let's get  back to surfing" session. Pretty happy with my call to go to the  Cliffs. And yes, I couldn't paddle worth shit.  <li> You have to give it to Ab. No matter how lame the swell, it  always generates the occasional nicely shaped wave. Especially at  the beginning of the session when the tide was at its lowest, my  first 3 rides were on greatly shaped waves, albeit small. Conditions  deteriorated slowly as the tide started coming in. At the end you just  had to be exactly on the peak to hope to catch a wave. Given that  the sets were not that frequent, it was very hard to keep the perfect  position and I missed several good waves, with a few of them waist-high.  <li> I was sort of amazed that there was not a single person out in sight.  Especially the older longboarder crew that's there on weekends early  in the morning. I've seen them paddle out in worse conditions than  this.  Perhaps the water is horribly contaminated (although the  Web didn't say anything) and I'll be dead tomorrow. On the drive back  I saw two shortboarders out though, sitting WAY on the inside at  Osprey. I can't imagine what you'd do on a short board on a day like  this. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Ab,  7:45AM-10AM (low tide at 10AM, 1.2ft)  <li> by myself, no one out for 1 hour, then up to 10 people out. Met  Reed, his son Shawn, and a friend of his son, James, in the line-up.  <li> on my 9'  <li> waist-high, not very consistent but nice sets coming through. Very  glassy, superb weather.  <li> There was one guy out when I paddled out, but he caught a wave in right  when I got to the line-up. I was alone for one hour and that's when the  conditions were best. After 1 hour, although the tide was dropping, it  became much less consistent and many waves were barely breaking. That's  when people starting paddling out, including Reed, etc. I hung out there  catching the occasional wave, and sort of feeling sorry for them ("You  should have been here an hour ago, mate"). It was nice talking to Reed  though. I had a terrible time catching a last wave in. My arms were  really weak and the waves were very hard to catch. My paddling was  infinitely better than two days ago though. Finally I paddled in  and caught a wave on the inside. There was a guy without a wetsuit out,  really good longboarder. Pretty soulful but I just can't imagine how he  didn't freeze to death.  <li> Caught 20 rides, with about 10 of them really fun with many turns,  a bit of cross-stepping, etc.  On a few waves I felt that I was moving  better on the board, getting low on my knees to pick up speed, moving  my body to gain speed during bottom turns, etc.  <li> I ate it on a very late take-off. Made it to my feet and went  down the face, but stuck the nose in the water during the bottom. I also  caught a wave that was too sectiony and that closed out on my head  as I was riding it. I got completely knocked off the board. But other  than these two, most of my take-offs were decent. I guess surfing  Ab is great backside surfing practice. There was that longboarder  out at the end of the session who surfed only the rights, which are  just completely mushy with no face to speak of at Ab.  <li> From the Cliffs, on the way up, it seems that Ab actually was the  spot that was working the worst (although it was great earlier). New  Break looked marginally better, and so did South Garbage and Garbage.  There were about 20 people out at Garbage, all in an area that couldn't  have been larger than 30ft by 30ft.  <li> In the parking lot this guy who smelled of bad  red wine pulled in and talked to me about being Portuguese, about  surfing double-overhead at the Mexican Banzai Pipeline last month, about  ordering a special fast board from South Coast to go surf Island  waves, and about not getting in the water today because it was  just too small for him because he's used to surfing Pipe. Very weird. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub,  6:30AM-8:00AM (low tide at 12:45PM, 0.2ft)  <li> by myself, about 7-8 people out. Met Sylvia in the water.  <li> on my 7'6''  <li> chest-high to 2ft-overhead, not very consistent, mostly glassy.  <li> The tide was a bit high early in the morning and I opted for the  Cliffs anyway because I couldn't get up North and I felt that OB  and MB would be closing out. The tide made it difficult to catch  waves and surprisingly it got worse as the session went on. There is  something odd going on at mid-tide at Sub perhaps, not sure.  Perhaps  the Cliffs wasn't the best call.  <li> I opted to surf somewhere a bit on the inside because the outside  was monopolized by those 3 killer longboarders. One of them spent  so much time on the nose on all the 7ft right-handers it was just  disgusting. There was no way I could've caught a wave there. That  meant I got caught inside when big sets were coming through, perhaps  every 20 minutes, which was quite a work-out. Overall, pretty happy  with my paddling and my stamina. At no point did I just feel exhausted.  <li> Caught 4 rides, with the first one really, really excellent on a 6ft  wave. Did quite a few fast turns. I still feel that I am not completely  controlling those turns completely because the board is so quick,  but apparently it looked ok because Sylvia said it was awesome.  On one of the other rides I tried to do a wide turn and ended up  overshooting and falling on my back.  <li> Completely ate it on a couple of waves due to to late take-offs. In  particular on that 8ft one on the outside (I paddled out there  towards the end of the session), where I got to my feet but I had  barely gotten into the wave and I ended up being completely dumped.  <li> Overall, no too happy with my performance. I had a very hard time  reading the waves and positioning myself, as well as a hard time  getting used to this board again. I could have easily caught twice  as many rides. But that first ride made it all worth it. Besides,  being in the water when there's size is such a great experience.  <li> On the bigger sets, Ab and Sub were completely connecting, with  the guys catching lefts at Ab ending up on the inside at Sub.  I had only seen that a couple times.  <li> From the parking lot, South Garbage looked like it was pretty much  on fire. About 30 people out there. I don't even want to see the place  at noon when the tide's low. It's going to be a complete zoo. Tomorrow  is supposed to be humongous, that that's what everybody was talking  about. Probably too big for me and besides I can't go out because of  work. I'll try to go to Blacks for lunch and check out the waves  though. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2005_Jan_21">Fri 21 Jan 2005</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Del Mar 15th, 6:00AM-7:20AM (low tide at 6:30AM, 5.6ft)  <li> by myself, about 20 people out on each break  <li> on my 7'6''  <li> chest-high to 3ft overhead, many close-outs, a bit of texture  on the water and bumpy on the inside, tide too high.  <li> I probably would have been better off on my 9ft given that the  tide was high. There were many longboarders out there. One of  them caught the wave of the day, which looked like it was DOH,  but it was a bit hard to tell from the angle.  <li> Caught 2 rides. It was very hard to get into waves, and with my 9ft  I could probably have gotten a few more rides. The first ride was  on a head-high wave, with the wave lining up as a wall with no  real opportunity for any maneuver. Surfed through the first  section really fast, perhaps 20 yards, and then turned towards the  beach as the wave closed out behind me. The second ride was on a 7ft  wave I'd say. I made the drop, and there was a guy right in my line.  I tried to turn, but hit a bump and the board when flying. Not too  close to the guy, but still, in his general direction. That wasn't  too cool. Had he not been there it could have been a cool ride.  <li> It was very hard to position oneself, the inside was a wall, there  were too many people out, and I still suck on that board (more than  on the other board, that is).  So overall quite a challenging session. But it was cool to be in  the water with those big sets looming on the horizon, sort of like  in a surf movie. Total corduroy. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2005_Jan_22">Sat 22 Jan 2005</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Mission Beach, 8:45AM-10:30AM (high tide at 7AM, 5.9ft)  <li> with Roland and "Big Wave" Dave  <li> on my 7'6''  <li> chest-high to head-high, a tad windy, not very consistent and a bit mixed up  <li> Due to the still quite high tide, the waves were rather fat and  difficult to get into, and yet there were many close-outs. Still a  few good rides to be had. Talking on the beach with Roland before  getting in, he was saying how one should take a longboard out because  it was fat, but how one should take a shortboard out because it  was closing out. I guess my 7'6'' was as good a compromise as any.  <li> Caught 6 rides. Only of of them ended up not closing out at  some point. On the others, I made the drop, went really fast  through the first section, and turned towards the beach as the  wave would close out behind me. Still, it was good to make those  drops and given the conditions I am pretty happy with this session.  Caught a wave in while Roland and Dave stayed out there.  <li> 2 dolphins beyond the line-up, one seal on the inside. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2005_Jan_23">Sun 23 Jan 2005</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> North of Swami, 7:45AM-10:00AM (high tide at 7:45AM, 6ft)  <li> with Jaime, Anaika, and two friends of Anaika's, Mike and Andreas.  Two kayakers out for the first hour, and then up to 4-5 other  people out.  <li> on my 9'  <li> waist-high with a few rare waves at chest-high, very glassy for 1  hour, with beautiful warm weather (I surfed with the top of my  wetsuit down), and then windy, choppy, foggy, and cold at the end  of the session. Not very consistent but a few nice sets coming in.  <li> The high tide made it difficult to get into waves at first, but  it got a bit better as the tide dropped. I had never surfed that spot  before. It's about 1/4 mile North of Swami. It was the first time  I was paddling through Swami actually, and yes, the shape is just  great there, and waves were bigger and better there than anywhere  else around. But there were easily 30 guys out, and not nearly  enough waves for everyone.  <li> Caught about 20 rides. None of them spectacular, some of them quite  fun. Sort of mushy and weak though. Did a little bit of  cross-stepping.  <li> As usual, going from my 7'6'' to my 9', I felt like I could  catch anything. The two friends of Anaika's had shorter boards  and it was almost impossible for them to get anything. Towards  the end of the session, as it was windy, foggy, and cold, this  older guy paddled out wearing nothing but trunks. Quite hard-core. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2005_Jan_24">Mon 24 Jan 2005</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub, 11AM-1PM (high tide at 8AM, 6.2ft)  <li> by myself. Up to 7 people in the line-up  <li> on my 9'  <li> waist-high, with a few chest-high sets, glassy, not very consistent,  mushy on the inside.  <li> I decided to go for a midday session as I was working from home today.  Tried to strike a compromise between the tide and the crowd, by going  at 11AM. Beautiful weather. I was in a wonderful mood as I got  the the beach. Sub looked a bit more consistent than Ab, somehow, but  there were 4 people out, while there was only one guy at Ab, this  older guy I had seen before. So I paddled out to Ab. As I  got close to the guy who was out I said "Good Morning", to which  he answered "Stay out of my way, that's the only thing I ask".  Talk about putting a downer on my cheerful mood. Ab wasn't  consistent at all, and after catching a couple waves on the  inside I paddled out to Sub. I just hate it when the vibe is so  negative, and it was just the two of us out there!  <li> Caught about 20 rides at Sub, with a few fun ones. On two waves I had to  take-off straight because of people in my line, but other than  that it was pretty open out there. Caught waves a bit on the inside,  mostly lefts, and thus missed the 2 or 3 better sets that came through.  Got caught on the inside once and had to paddled back out to the  channel. Quite a work out. People were pretty mellow out there  and I slowly recovered from the terrible initial vibe.  <li> By the time I got out Ab was much better than Sub, due to the lower tide,  and there were about 10 people out.  <li> On my last wave in, a right, that girl sort of dropped in on me, although  she was 30ft to my right. I didn't care, it was my last wave, so I rode it behind her. Then she dropped on her knees to ride the white in, while I dropped on my stomach to do the same. We rode the wave like that, side by side for about 50 yards. She then smiled and apologized for "cutting me off", to which I replied "it doesn't matter, it was a fun last wave". That was in such contrast to the beginning of the session.  <li> After the session I went to OB for a smoothie while reviewing a paper.  I could get used to surfing in the middle of weekdays :) </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Del Mar 15th, 6:45AM-8AM (low tide at 4:15AM, 1.8ft)  <li> by myself. Up to 25 people in the line-up, but I stayed on  the edge  <li> on my 7'6''  <li> head-high with a few sets at a couple feet overhead. Many close-outs.  Really fat, with significant off-shore winds.  <li> It had to happen one day. This was the session with ZERO rides.  Basically, the waves were way too fat and the off-shore too strong  for me to get into on my 7'6''. I may have been able to catch one  wave on my 9', but it's not even clear. Basically, positioning was  the key and as usual I was having trouble with it. There was one  shortboarder out who was taking off right on the peak, pretty  much in the white. There were a couple of longboarders who were  able to take off on corners after really intense paddling. And most  people out there, including yours truly, didn't catch a single  wave. After about one hour, I started paddling toward the inside  and I finally caught some white.  <li> Got caught in the impact zone a couple of times (looked behind  me, ditched the board, and dove), trying to position myself for a  take-off, and always being either too far out or too far in.  <li> I guess the one good thing about this session is that paddling  out was such a bitch that I had a good workout. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2005_Jan_31">Mon 31 Jan 2005</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub and Ab, 6:45AM-8:30AM (low tide at 6:55AM, 1.8ft)  <li> by myself. Two other longboarders out at Sub for 1 hour, and nobody  out at Ab when I went there (7-8 guys when I paddled out to Sub).  <li> on my 9'  <li> waist-high with the occasional set at chest-high. Sort of high  frequency and a bit mixed up, not very powerful and mushy but decent shape on the bigger waves.  <li> Caught about 20 rides at Sub, none of them particularly impressive  although I had some good take-offs on a couple of waves. Mostly  rights. At some point it looked like both longboarders would drop  in on me at the same time, but they didn't.  <li> Conditions got better and better, and then there was a long lull  during which I realize that I was the only one out. So I paddled  to Ab to try to catch waves there. It was definitely sort of  a challenging day at Ab. Not because of the size, but because it  was sort of breaking all over the place, sometimes with two peaks,  sometimes with the two peaks connecting, sometimes way outside, etc.  And since I was the only one out, positioning was a bit more  difficult. And it was pitching a little bit too. I thought it would  be a good experience anyway.  <li> Made 5 drops at Ab. Two of them were kind of late. On one of them  I was trying to stay on a high line, and I almost made it but then the  section right ahead of me broke on my back. Two feet further down the  line and I would've been fine. I think that if I had crouched and held  the rail I could've gotten a "California barrel", but instead I fell.  Towards the end it was getting difficult to catch waves. On a  couple I didn't really get into the wave fast enough and ended up not  making it. Eventually caught a small wave in.  <li> Surfing Ab today was a great experience although I didn't do great.  Positioning is really key at that place. This morning I was  actually watching one of the guys out there who was exactly in the  right spot every time. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub, 8AM-9:30AM (high tide at 3:45AM, 5.1ft)  <li> with Dario. Nobody out at first and then two girls paddled  out halfway through the session.  <li> on my 9ft  <li> It was Dario first session in 6 months, the day after he got back  to San Diego after one year of exile. He got back into it pretty  quickly.  <li> Caught about 10 rides, with a few good ones with nice take-offs, a bit of cross-stepping and nice turns. Had two pathetic take-offs that made Dario laugh.  <li> Toward the end of the session we drifted closer and closer to Ab, which was weird. I caught a nice left there, while we were pretty much in the channel. We then caught small waves in.  <li> Overall a very nice mellow session with nice weather. The waves at Ab and South Garbage looked nice from the parking lot. </ul></blockquote>

One of them I caught on the outside where I was somehow  completely alone, which was cool.  <li> It got crowded after the first hour and so we paddled a bit North,  off the main break. Not breaking very nicely there as usual. Caught  a couple of waves and went in. It was a beautiful morning.  <li> Played with Anaika's dogs for a little bit by the car.  <li> 5+ dolphins in the line-up in two instances. </ul></blockquote>

Nobody out.  <li> on my 9ft  <li> waist-high, glassy, not very consistent, with a few  rare bigger sets. Sort of closing out, dumping on the inside,  and still not very easy to get into waves due to the tide.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with 2 really good ones, which was surprising  given the conditions really. Sort of continuing the good wave karma  from yesterday's session.  <li> I tried Jaime's 9'4'' high-perf noserider for about 5 waves. It's  a pretty cool board and I may want to try to get one like that. But  it's definitely slower than mine... not sure what to do. Took off  on the biggest wave of the day on his board. It was a really steep  take-off and I sunk the nose at the bottom turn. I am wondering  if I would've made it on my board.  <li> 10+ dolphins here and there, with some of them coming emerging  close. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2005_Feb_16">Wed 16 Feb 2005</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Sunset Cliffs (Sub), 6:45AM-8:30AM (low tide at 11:15AM, 0.75ft)  <li> with Dario. Nobody out.  <li> on my 7'6''  <li> chest-high, a bit of texture in the water, getting windier as the  session went on. Not very consistent, and waves were a bit difficult  to get into because many were quite fat. But several very nice sets  coming through, some of them head-high and very well lined-up, with  others a bit mushy on the inside.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with one of them absolutely outstanding. A  right that was perfectly lined-up and which I surfed all the way  to the channel. Probably the nicest Sub wave I've surfed in over  a year. Dario caught an amazing right too, bigger than the one I  caught.  <li> Dario noted that on my 7'6'' my feet are way too close together, which  was really helpful. In fact, on my last wave, a left, my take-off was  much better as I spread my feet more. It's just so useful to surf  with somebody who went through the same thing you are going through  and can point things out to you. Basically, on my longboard I am  now ok with foot placement, but I am back to the drawing board  on my 7'6''.  <li> We had a pretty bad case of "waiting for the last wave". It was  getting more and more blown out. I ended up trying for waves further  and further inside, until I just caught some white in.  <li> Overall a great session. Last night we checked the forecast  and it said "unsurfable" (due to a storm which we still have to  see as the sky is perfectly blue and winds are calm as I write  this). Dario was at my place and I had to lend my car to Renata  whose car had broken down. We decided to try for it anyway. I  spent the night at Charlie's and we ended up scoring a great  session. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Mission Beach, 8:99AM-9:30AM (high tide at 7:20AM, 6.7ft)  <li> with Dario. One other guy out and a few shortboarders on the inside  occasionally  <li> on my 9'  <li> waist-high, with a lot of nice waves (and a few perhaps at  chest-high). The tide was really high and we managed to score  great waves before it dropped too much and waves started closing  out.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with 3 or 4 on very good waves. Overall I  did OK, but after 3 weeks without surfing, and being sick for the  last week, I felt really weak out there. Anyway, it was pretty  much Mission Beach at its best, and it was mellow enough that it  was a good session to get back into it. I feel completely exhausted  as I write this though. I'll just have to try to survive the day.  <li> Dario surfed really well and caught many more waves than I did.  <li> 6+ dolphins on and off in the line-up, some of them less than 10 yards  away from us. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2005_March_11">Fri 11 March 2005</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Beacons, 6:45-9:15AM (high tide at 9:40AM, 5.3ft)  <li> with Dario, Jaime, and Ari. 10+ people out  <li> on my 7'6''  <li> chest- to overhead-high, a lot of clean waves, glassy.  <li> I had a very hard time on my 7'6''. I couldn't really get into  the waves because I had to tell them late and they were heavy  and fast.  <li> For 1 hour I couldn't catch a ride. The only opportunity that I think  I could have taken, some guy was already on the wave and I had to let  him go. It was a very humbling experience to see people rip left and  right. I think the waves were just a bit heavier, I am still really  struggling on my 7'6'', and I was actually kind of tired. But still,  I just need to learn how to take off a bit later.  <li> After 1 hour, Jaime and I swapped board for 10 minutes. I  immediately caught a great right. I felt so much better on his  9'4'' it was incredible. I knew at that moment that if I had had  my 9' with me I would have had an amazing session. Jaime totally  kicked ass on my board, but then wanted to swap back because he  just didn't feel confident enough in conditions this heavy.  <li> I then caught 2 rides (lefts) on my 7'6''. The first one was  lame, with by back foot in the perfect position, but my front foot  to close to the back foot. But at least I made the drop. The second  one was much better, but there was a guy in the inside and I played  it safe by straightening up to the beach as opposed to trying to go  around him on a high line.  <li> Overall, I think I learned a lot during this session, but while  everybody was completely stoked after it, I was at the same time  regretting that I didn't have my longboard, and at the same time  happy that I was putting time on my 7'6''.  <li> 10 dolphins in the line-up </ul></blockquote>

This was  pretty much Mission Beach at its best, with only a few days  like this every year.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with 3 or 4 very good. I didn't feel  very confident on the board today and my style was worse than  usual, but still night and day compared to yesterday.  <li> I pulled a very sketchy take-off on a head-high wave, which  was pretty cool. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Waikiki, 7:30AM-9:30AM (low tide at 7:20AM, .3ft)  <li> On a SHITTY 9ft board, epoxy, single fin, no wax. $18 for 2 hours.  Had to run back to the hotel to get a credit card, then lost a  $20.00 bill, which the rental guy found and gave me back later. A  whole adventure. I saw the guy later in the afternoon and he  recognized me and we talked for 5 minutes. The stereotypical  older, somewhat alcoholic, Waikiki beach boy I guess. It's been  SO easy to talk to people here.  <li> with Greg, that local Hawaiian guy from the big island whom  I met on the beach while I was waiting to rent a board, from 10 to  20+ people out, mostly beginners, and a surf instructor.  <li> knee- to waist-high, with a few (very few) chest-high waves,  completely glassy, most waves kind of weak, but a few good ones  with long rides.  <li> Caught more than 20 rides, more than most people out there, with  2 or 3 that were great (mostly rights), longer than 100 yards for  sure. I caught the wave of the day when a set seemed to approach  and I paddled hard outside to find myself the only one there. People  were either very mellow or beginners and I was paddling like a maniac  all over the place, which in retrospect perhaps wasn't too cool. But  the "first Hawaiian session" syndrome was in full effect I guess.  <li> The surf instructor was hilarious. Really heavy set Hawaiian in his  20s, surfing a massive log and pushing that lady onto waves. He saved  my life by giving me wax and we talked a bit. Really, really  friendly. So far I am really amazed at how friendly the locals  I've met are.  <li> On a tiny wave I almost hit a girl. I was going very, very slow,  but due to the lack of wax and the fact that it was a toe-high wave  I just couldn't change direction. No harm at all, but I cursed that  board for the 100th time at that point. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Waikiki, 7:30AM-9:30AM (low tide at 7:40AM, 0.3ft)  <li> On the same board as yesterday, but this time with wax.  <li> with Pascal and we met Greg in the water. That was Pascal's  first session.  <li> Smaller than yesterday and a bit windier, knee-high with a few  waist-high waves. Many waves just mushing out on the inside.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with none of them close to the best ones  I caught yesterday, but I surfed much better on that board with  wax on it.  <li> As we were getting in the water some loser talked to us, asking  us if we were "AWESOME surfers", telling us to "HANG TEN DUDE!!!"  and then asking us what "hanging ten" actually meant, telling us  he was going to take a surf lesson, stepping on my leash forcing  me to ask him to move his foot, and as we paddled out he hooted  at us really loud from the beach. Really sad and embarrassing. I  paddled out as fast as I could at that point. </ul></blockquote>

Lefts were mushing out today. We didn't catch any wave for the  first half-hour due to the high tide, but things improved. I had  two great take-offs, one of them on a head-high right that went  on forever all the way to the inside of the channel.  <li> I had a few lame take-offs. Nothing really bad, but still my feet  too close together. I am just happy that I had by far my best  take-off on the best wave.  <li> Dario had a few great take-offs on pretty heavy rights. We scored  major waves, the weather became sunny halfway through the session  and we were pretty much alone. Really good call to go out between  my trip to Hawaii and my trip to Houston.  <li> One seal in the line-up. I made a drop and went about 2ft from  its head.

Although it looked mellow  and knee-high, once we got in we realized there were mostly  close-outs, high-frequency, and just not fun. After 1/2 hour in the  water we decided to just go to the Cliffs. I had caught only one ride  and the paddle back out was really a pain.  <li> Once at the Cliffs we went all the way to Chasm as Sub was crowded and  Ab seemed to mushy. Chasm was actually pretty good, very glassy,  waist-high with a few almost chest-high waves. I caught about 25  rides there. Shortboarders started paddling out (up to 6 other  guys out). I was very careful in trying not to steal their waves,  which worked out ok. Two of the guys out really annoyed Dario and  when it got too crowded we decided to paddle to the next spot South.  <li> We got to the next spot, which we think is 33's. There were two older  longboarders there. The wave was very nice, with quite some punch to it  and showing the potential it can have on a bigger day. I caught perhaps  20 rides, with most of them really fun (especially on rights).  <li> It was an odd morning, with 3 different surf spots and a single-fin board.  It took quite a bit of time to get used to the single-fin.  <li> Major technical break-through today: I managed to consistently put my hands  further back on the board as I push off for a take-off. I really helped  for having my feet spread out more. I did it consistently throughout the  whole session, and I think it won't be a problem anymore.  <li> We were quite exhausted after this long morning.

Travis was much  better at this.  <li> Toward the end of the session we tried to paddle north a bit to  try to catch a left, but we just weren't moving. There seemed to  be this current that kept us always in the same place. It was  crazy, just seemed impossible to get to that left we saw breaking  only a few yards away. At some point, I knew I was just facing  exhaustion so I caught some serendipitous white in on my stomach.  The white was pretty fast. It was impossible to tell where I was  going because of the sun and the haze on the beach. I started  being concerned about hitting the rocks by the pointe at chasm  and fought hard to go as far north as possible, edging the white  and paddling. I eventually made it out on the beach, WAY north,  close to New Break. I really had no idea where I was it turns  out. I lied down on the beach and waited for Travis for ever. He  finally made it, further south than where I was. Apparently he  caught some white, but not getting as much north as I did. He  said that it was the fastest white he's ever ridden, and then he  stayed stuck in the same spot, caught in some type of rip current  on the inside. Eventually made it out to the beach, but quite  freaked out. We laughed our asses off. Then, on the way back to  Ab we had to put our leashes on again to paddled around the  pointe, which had become quite something with the tide rising.  Anyway, it was quite an adventure all-in-all and although we  laughed it off, bigger conditions in winter would have made it  really hard to come back to the parking lot. </ul></blockquote>

Spent about 1.5 hour in the line-up  at Tourmaline. Caught about 20 rides there. The waves were slow  (of course), but I had two great waves, on which I was by myself  on the outside, just in the right spot. Both rights. On the best  one of the two, this asshole dropped in on me. I had seen him before  dropping in on many people. He's a good surfer, shouts in the line-up  like he owns the place, and just drops in and then gives you this look  that says: "what the hell were you doing on my wave?". Unreal. I can  take the beginners who drop in because they don't know any better. But  that guy is just such an obvious asshole, I just couldn't figure it out.  <li> There was this guy out, no wetsuit, overweight, sitting on his log,  never catching a single wave. Never paddling for anything. Obviously  not really able to surf and just hanging out hoping to become a surfer  I guess. But he was very nice and pointed out waves to me. It was  pretty funny. Each time I got back to the line-up I sort of said  "thanks", although I can figure out waves on my own but I took  pity on him. And he always gave me that look like: "well, I can't  surf, so at least I try to be helpful". Pretty odd. One wave he  pointed out I hadn't seen though because I was messing around  with my leash. So I guess he was helpful.  <li> As I was getting ready to paddle out to PB Pointe, Jaime showed  up. We both paddled there and it was only 4 of us in the line-up,  with pretty good waves. Caught about 5 rides there, with one  screaming right on which I probably made the sketchiest drop I ever  did but was somewhat in control.  <li> On one wave, which was Jaime's he yelled at me "Go!" which made  me think that he wasn't going or that he was going left. But as I  dropped in he was right next to me. I freaked and pearled. I had NO  idea he meant for both of us to ride the wave. That man is insane. </ul></blockquote>

Cross-stepping right after take-off would've been the way to go I  think.  <li> Very low tide and clear water, the first 30 yards of paddling were  beautiful with fish and green seaweed, and several stingrays on  the bottom.  <li> 2 dolphins on the outside </ul></blockquote>

Two waist-high  sets came through.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with a couple of lefts that were decent, with  a bit of cross-walking. It's really amazing how Ab sort of generates  nice waves even when there is no swell whatsoever.  <li> From the parking lot we could see people sitting on their board  at South Garbage, in the middle of a lake basically.

<h2> <a name="2005_May_28">Sun 28 May 2005</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Ab and then 33's, 6:15AM-8AM (low tide at 9:20AM, -0.5ft)  <li> on my 9'  <li> By myself, nobody out  <li> Knee-high, glassy, very inconsistent. In fact, worse than  yesterday.  <li> Caught 10 rides at Ab, none of them great, and then I decided  to go for a long paddle, just for the workout. So I paddled  from Ab to 33's. That was quite intense, but I had seen some waves  breaking there and I decided it would be a good experience.  <li> The paddle took perhaps 1/2 hour, and it was a bit spooky to  be completely by myself in the ocean. The only sign of human life  was on the beach where two transients had set up camp on the beach  by New Break.  <li> I finally got to 33's and although I had seen waves break, there  was nothing going on. I just sat there and waited. It got spookier.  There was a lot of fish activity, with fish jumping out of the water  all around me,  a lot of odd bubbles and water movement going on.  I was in somewhat shallow water and I could see the bottom. There  were garibaldis at the bottom, bright orange. But with the sky  being completely overcast, the whole scene was just eerie.  <li> And then a set came. It was amazing to realize that even on a  knee-high day like this, with no swell, that little reef can still  generate waves. It was above waist-high on the take-off, and quite  heavy actually, with steep take-offs and the absolute necessity  of keeping a high line. Then dead calm again for 10 minutes with  more unsettling water movements and fish jumping. And then, another  set. I caught about 5 waves overall, made all take-offs, but had  to really be focused. I can't even imagine that place on a big  day.  <li> I paddled back to New Break and then got out of the water and  finished on foot. Quite the workout.  <li> 1 seal in the line-up at Ab, maybe the same one as yesterday. </ul></blockquote>

Tons of kelp.  <li> Caught a total of 7 rides, with one great right that felt like it  was head-high on the drop. I did a nice bottom turn and came back up  on the face to keep a high line, and then plunged to a second bottom  turn to go around a semi-closing out section. After that the wave  got mellower and I cut back into the pocket, to finish by kicking  the board out before the wave closed out on the inside. That ride  made this otherwise lame session all worth it.  <li> Before getting in the water I almost locked myself out of my  car. I left the key in the front of the car and locked the door  while getting out of the car. I thought I was completely screwed  until I realized I could take the back seats down through the  trunk, which I had opened from the front right before getting out.  So I managed to crawl through the back seats and retrieve the key. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Rincon Pointe, 6AM-8AM (low tide at 8AM, 0ft)  <li> on Graziano's 9'  <li> by myself, 15 people out  <li> knee- to chest-high, not a very clean swell but a few good sets coming  through. The pointe looked rather heavy and was owned by ripping  shortboarders who were getting barreled every now and again and pulled  quite amazing stuff. So I hung out about halfway along the pointe, with  all the longboarders.  <li> Caught 7 rides, with one of them outstanding.  <li> My first 3 rides were sort of lame, with sketchy take-offs and then  an odd wave with a crazy wedge and a lot of reflection from the pointe.  I really had problems gaining speed on the board and couldn't quite  escape from the wedge although the take-offs were fun.  <li> My fourth ride was outstanding. I was a bit on the outside, and caught that  wave that I rode all the way to the beach, perhaps 200 yards. It was a bit slow  at times but had a few faster sections that were really fun. That really gave  me an appreciation for what Rincon Pointe can do. It was actually difficult to  figure out where to be along the point, with a few spots not breaking, some  too heavy, etc.  <li> The crowd was really friendly by a few annoying people who were  totally friendly but would drop in. Towards the end there was  this girl who paddled out. She totally sucked but she was  behaving somewhat aggressively in the water. On one wave she  tried to catch I was on the inside sort of in her line I guess, but  there was NO way she was going to catch that wave. In fact I couldn't  catch it either and I didn't even try. But she paddled sort of aggressively  but not very well right toward me and stopped like 2 ft from my  board giving me this eye although at that point she was paddling  on flat water. I couldn't believe it. She couldn't even stand, as  I saw later.  <li> I sort of messed up my last rides, either because I was too deep or because  this older lady would drop in on me. I missed a couple of opportunities because  I just had a hard time reading some of the waves. I finally caught a wave in.  Overall a decent session, and pretty happy that I finally surfed Rincon Pointe,  although I can't really say I was at the pointe. </ul></blockquote>

For some  reason with my smaller fin I find backside riding more difficult.  <li> It was dolphin insanity. Maybe 10 dolphins in total, who stayed in  the line-up for 45 minutes or so, jumping, surfing, rolling over  each other. Not sure what was going on but it was quite entertaining.  On a wave I actually had two in my line and I paddled right over  them on the take-off. </ul></blockquote>

I  lost my board on a very late take-off in white water on an ugly  wave and had to swim to the beach to get the board back. I really  enjoy surfing without a leash and I think I am going to do it  probably non-stop until I move to Hawaii.  <li> Charles had to stop after 45 minutes because he tweaked his  back again, which sucked. I went to the beach to check on him and  decided to paddle out for one more wave. I paddled out really fast,  showed up in the middle of the 5 guys out, sat on my board, saw  a wave coming, turned and caught it right away back to the beach.  The whole thing took like 3 minutes. It was pretty funny. It was odd  also to be the best surfer in the line-up. The other guys out were  the usual longboarder locals and they frankly suck, although  they are not aggressive and are overall nice guys. </ul></blockquote>

I either had to pull out after 10 yards or I would  get to the inside, which was such a mess that the wave would  become unrideable. Still was fun to do those take-offs though  and it was nice to feel the energy behind the bigger set. I felt  that I was close to my best shape in terms of paddling, always  able to accelerate enough to escape from bad close-outs.  <li> I toyed with the idea of paddling out without a leash.

I lost my board a total of 4 times,  which I guess is not too horrible, but still. The first time  was a late take-off, and I had sort of "forgotten" that I didn't  have a leash. The second time what really annoying. I pulled this  quite extreme take-off, which to be honest I didn't think I had  in me, and was gearing up to scream through a fast section. I could  totally have done it and reached the second part of the wave that was  perfectly lined up. But that beginning longboarder dropped in on me,  rode the wave on his stomach, got on his knees, and fell right  in front of me. I had to do a major cut-back, which put me  right in the close-out, and I lost my board. The third time I did  another sketchy take-off and pulled it off, and I was facing yet  another fast section that was almost closing out. Unfortunately  there was some guy in my line. I couldn't take a low line, so I  took the high line, getting really close to the crest of the  wave. I made it past him by holding on to the rail of the board  while the white starting falling on my board. I was pretty happy  with that move, but then, after I passed him, I couldn't make  it back down the face smoothly, was off-balance, and just fell  into the wave. This one I think that with more experience I could  totally have avoided by going over the top of the wave. I went to  fetch my board a third time (about 200 yard swim), made it back to  the line-up, said one sentence to Travis, just to find ourselves in  the impact zone of by far the biggest set of the day (I'd say 1ft  overhead). Everybody got completely pummeled, including Travis, and  of course I lost my board. I swam back in again, missed the board  on the way, got to the beach, couldn't find it, and then spotted  it halfway between the line-up and the beach. Had to swim out to  get it. Then barely made it past bigger and bigger sets. It  really started to become clear that with the increase in size a  leash was really necessary for me. At that point I was exhausted,  and I caught a wave in. I guess this was a learning experience. </ul></blockquote>

The shore break was a tad heavy (but nothing really), and he couldn't  really deal with it. I tried to give him some advice, but it wasn't  working really well. He kept being hit by the white at an angle  and being rolled with the board.  <li> I took the board and went out for 1/2 hour. Really bad conditions,  with a rather strong on-shore, climbing tide, and very few  rideable waves. Caught 3 rides total, none of them good.  <li> Paddled back in to go to back to the bbq where my students were  all waiting for me to give me gifts (an iShuffle, a pair of  flip-flops, and the complete DVD collection of Stephen Chou's  movies!) </ul></blockquote>

I was  so annoyed at having a leash and at the kelp that I just  unstrapped the leash from my ankle and let it drag in the water.  Somehow, Kathy has a leash that cannot be easily removed from the  board!  <li> The last ride of the day was on an almost chest-high rogue wave  that came from nowhere. Really fun drop, and a nice way to  end the session.  <li> Paul did better than last time, and did not get sea sick.  <li> At the beginning of the session, in an amazing flash of brilliance,  I locked the keys of the car inside the trunk of the car. It was  an odd combination of attaching the keys to my surf trunks, and  then changing trunks. Anyway, I decided that we should go surfing  and then I would call AAA from Charlie's. That's exactly what we  did, and within 1/2 hour the car was unlocked. It was absolutely  amazing how fast the guy was to open the door. He used two sheets  of hard plastic, an inflatable pouch, and a piece of wire.  Really, really impressive and of course a life saver.

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub, 6:30AM-8:30AM  <li> on my 9'  <li> with Jaime, Anaika, and Andreas. up to 15 other people out.  <li> waist-high to chest-high, no wind, glassy, organized, consistent, perfect.  <li> FINALLY! Great conditions. Caught about 20 rides, mostly rights,  with all of them decent and some of them absolutely great.  <li> On one waist-high wave, I did perhaps my best, most stylish take-off  ever. It was a right, and I was to the left of the peak. I popped up  fast and very low, cut through the peak to the right, and cut back  slightly on a high line. I really felt great for that take-off, and  Jaime confirmed that he'd never seen me so stylish and graceful  on a wave before. If only I could do it 100% of the time.  <li> Then came a rogue head-high+ wave. Jaime and I were the only ones  in position and willing to go I guess. But I was WAY too deep.  I decided to make the drop anyway, about 7-8 yards behind Jaime. I  pulled it off, somehow. And then the wave just became a vertical  wall and started covering me, as if I was going to get barreled. Jaime  was at the end of the tunnel and I had no hope of catching up. I opted  to dive into the wall. I was turned around under water for a bit,  with everything turning black. I touched the bottom softly and  came up. That was the closest I ever got to appreciate the feeling  one must get when on gets barreled. It was really something else.  It was very "sketchy", but very fun. I was totally energized after  that and paddled for waves like a maniac.  <li> A VERY nice wave formed up and this guy was deeper than both Jaime  and I. In fact he was in the perfect spot and both of us were  sort of jealous. He was so in the perfect place that we didn't  even go for it, and at the last minute he bailed. He turned  toward us sheepishly and said something like: "That wave was too  fast". That was completely ridiculous as the wave wasn't faster  than any other out there, and definitely not as fast as the big  one I had dropped in before. On the next wave he was again deeper  than I was, and I should just have snaked him and then said:  "Sorry, I thought that one was going to be too fast for you". But  no. I haven't reached that level of surf nazism yet :)  <li> Fell on one ride after hitting a kelp bed.  <li> We really had a great time and I've been on a surf high all day.  It was the first time Anaika surfed that spot and she just couldn't  believe it. It was high time I showed it to her as I am moving to  Hawaii in one week. She claims it was the best conditions she'd  ever surfed in San Diego. And I've seen this place working better.  I think she's hooked. I was really happy with the way I was able to  hold my own in the line-up and catch so many waves. And all this  after sleeping only 4 hours last night because Jaime had dragged Paul  and me to see the Femi Kuti show (which was pretty good I have to  admit).  <li> One jellyfish in the line-up.  <li> For the first time since I've started surfing, I had water come out  of my nose about one hour after the session when I bent over to  pick up something! Must have happened when I ate it on that big  wave. I feel so much more like a real surfer now. </ul></blockquote>

It was really one of these sessions  when surfing seems so incredibly pure and simple.  <li> Caught about 30 rides, with some excellent ones. I tried to  work on my style, which led to a few lame rides because I was  pushing on things that are beyond my level, but with amazing  ones on which I would have a graceful take-off, go up and down  the wave on the first sections, cut back and bank into the white, cross-step back up to  the nose, hang five, cross-step back and kick the board  out. There were perhaps 5 rides like that.  <li> My cross-stepping is still not quite smooth and a bit tentative.  I think that next I'll get a 9'4 noserider and see how that  works. Perhaps it will help.  <li> When I got out of the water, there were flights of pelicans  in the sky, the sun was just above the horizon, and the whole place  was just incredibly beautiful.

I was pretty happy with all my take-offs, including  a few late ones.  <li> There was a guy on the inside at Ab who was surfing with his dog  on his board. I talked to him a bit and he said the dog just will  NOT stay on the beach and will swim all the way to the line-up and  hang out, even on big days. That prevents the guy from taking the  dog to the beach on big days because he's afraid the dog would  drown. The dog was hilarious, and in fact would not get out of the  water at all, just swimming around.  <li> Another quite magical session in the beautiful sunset.

It paddles great. It trims great. And  it's really loose and turns really well. I was able to cross-step on  most rides, and I was very close to the nose on one of them for  2-3 seconds. The loose turning is really impressive. I have a 6.5''  fin on it.  <li> There were two locals out and they and I were catching most of  the waves. They surfed with fantastic style, with amazing turns  even on knee-high waves. They had pintail noseriders, just like the  ones I was trying to find. The shaper was Tadashi Suzuki I think. They  also had skegs that were curved towards the central fin and a central  fin with this tube in the middle that I had seen before (I had never  seen the curved skegs). At any rate, they were able to turn really,  really well.

 <li> Waikiki, Threes, 6AM-8AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> with Eric, 5-6 other people out  <li> I parked my car in one of the last few available parking spot  on the street, right behind that guy who had just arrived. We  started talking (his name's Eric, 50-something I'd say), I  borrowed a little bit of wax from him. That guy was full of  useful information. First, he told me that although the parking  was free until 7AM only, he'd never gotten a ticket until after 8AM.  Then, we walked together to the beach and he told me about all  the spots. The spot that I had surfed before was indeed called  Pops. The one straight ahead from the jetty is called Threes.  The one in between Pops and Threes is called Paradise. Then to  the Ewa side of Threes is Number Four. We paddled out together,  talking the whole time. Once in the line-up he introduced me to  Jim, Paul, Al, and a few other people whose name I forgot. One of  them I talked to quite a bit about surfing in San Diego. He'd been  there a couple times. The atmosphere was so friendly it was crazy.  They said that when it gets good it can get aggressive of course.  Apparently this is really the doldrums, and they had a great  early summer. We had great conversation in the water,  about some session  at Diamond head that was apparently shoulder-high on Monday, etc.  <li> knee- to waist-high, well shaped of course (this is Waikiki after  all), a bit windy towards the end of the session  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with nothing to write home about. Did some  ok cross-stepping. This board will get into ANY wave!  <li> While in the water, Eric was still full of good information. For  instance he told me that if, when sitting out there, one cannot  see the Diamond Head side of that particular building, then one is  to far on the Ewa side and the water's too deep for it to break at  all. That was SO useful. I am so lucky to have run into that guy.  He surfs every morning so I'll probably see him a lot,  especially because surfing Waikiki is so convenient for me as I can  easily go to work afterwards. This is such a great set up.  <li> Also, Eric talked to me about spots on the Winward side. Apparently  there is this spot called Rainbows in between Sugar Mills and Crouching  Lion that's pretty decent and not as crowded as the other two in  winter. He gave me directions to find it. I'll go check it out next  week.  <li> Then we paddled back in together. He told me how to tell that it  was getting close to 8. Every day there is this boat that drags  a submarine (some tourist thing). You can actually see the submarine  barely above the water behind the boat. When the boat gets at the  level of the jetty, it's 8AM. That was again such a cool/local thing  to know. So lucky I met that guy today.  <li> Overall lame conditions but a great session in terms of getting  to know the places in Hawaii. </ul></blockquote>

There are  no waves but I need to paddle out.  <li> The water was SO warm it was difficult to paddle. The place is  stunningly beautiful. The water was crystal-clear, with coral at  the bottom.  <li> Waves were ankle- to knee-high. I caught about 20 rides, none of them  good but it was amazing to glide on top of the coral.  <li> It was very shallow (3-4 feet) and at some point, while turning  the board around I hit the coral with my fin and my foot.

He's a bodysurfer who  picked up longboarding 2 years ago. His son was off to college on  the mainland and they were having a "let's go play in the water  one last time" session, in spite of there being no waves.

I caught a few more waves but nothing to write home about.  <li> Then it got really crowded and I just didn't feel I could compete in the  pack. There were at least 15 people out there who were just outstanding  surfers. Better than most people I've ever seen in San Diego. And the waves  were better than any waves I've ever seen in San Diego actually. So I started  surfing the inside. It was a bit nerve-wracking because when big sets came  we had to get out of people's way. There were a couple of instances when it  was a bit too close to my liking. But the guys surfing have such control it never  was an issue in fact. At some point I had to paddle out and turtle in between  two guys surfing the same wave. Speaking of, there was quite a bit of  dropping in, which I found surprising. In particular, one older guy just sort  of didn't care and dropped in on people. He wasn't that good though.  <li> I saw guys do amazing nose-rides, get semi-barreled, etc. Overall I am  really impressed by the level of surfing in the water. In fact, Edgar did  a couple of really insane late take-offs on 8ft lefts that were really  impressive. And he was so casual going down the face it was amazing.  <li> Once on the inside I caught about 20 rides, with one really, really, really  good right. I was behind Jim on that right (I could perhaps have gone left but  I was just tired of surfing backside), and he pulled out almost right  away. It was a great chest-high wave, head-high+ on the drop,  with some kick to it on the inside.  <li> I paddled in because the crowd got to be a bit too much and I was actually  getting quite tired. It was a good workout, paddling like crazy to get out  of people's way. It will take some time before I can deal with crowds like these,  but it was a lot of fun.  <li> After the session, while I was by my car, Edgar came to me and gave me a bag  of mangos from his mango tree! He's the nicest guy, and man can he take-off  late :) </ul></blockquote>

The place is absolutely beautiful.  <li> Caught perhaps 10 rides, with only two good ones with fun take-offs  on head-high waves. The waves were mushing out on the inside though.  All other rides were rather lame and it took an inordinate amount  of effort to get into the wave  <li> Talked with that older guy who used to surf this spot when he was 13  and just got back to surfing a week ago after a 40 year hiatus. Quite  interesting.  <li> Got sort of caught on the inside a couple of times, but nothing  too terrible. The waves were just all over the place, with huge  sets breaking on the outside, mutant waves coming from two directions  at once. At times it was so windy that I actually fell off my  board while sitting on it because the nose was too high up in  the air. It was sort of a good experience to be in this powerful  and unpredictable ocean.

It was sort of stunning to see that even  on a small day like today the take-off could be head-high on the  peak. Then the wave was sort of odd and bumpy, and rides weren't  too long. An occasional wave would line up though.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with 2-3 on nicely lined-up waves. All take-offs  were fun and not completely easy, which was good practice. My last  two waves were really good. The next-to-last was one of the biggest  waves of the session, and after a rather late and shaky take-off I  had a great ride. My last wave was well-lined up, and I made it through  a steep section by keeping a high line. It was a right but then sort  of reformed into a left. Very nice way to end the session.  <li> There was one rogue wave that loomed over the horizon for a while  and that I didn't manage to catch. The face was clearly 4ft bigger than  anything during the session.  <li> Jim and that other guy whose name I keep forgetting joined me at  Paradise after being sitting ducks at Number Threes like I had done  1/2 hour before them.  <li> 1 sea turtle briefly in the line-up.

The first time was on a sketchy  take-off, which I totally made, but then on the bottom turn I went  a little bit too low and I buried the nose.

The second time was on a mutant bumpy head-high  wave and I made the drop just for the hell of it. It was a rush.  <li> Overall a great session, with great take-off.

In particular, I am really much lower,  bending my knees much more, on the take-off. Not sure how it  happened. I think part of it is just watching so many people  surfing with great style here, and somehow absorbing a bit of  their technique. In particular, today there were one older  Chinese guy who surfed absolutely beautifully.  I really tried to  emulate his style a bit, but I am SO far from that.

Paradise is so weird. The peak always has some size, but it's just  a peak. So today there were a few take-offs that were I guess a bit  intense given the conditions, and I caught about 10 waves there.

He encouraged me to go, and told  me about a few spots, confirming what my student Mike had told me. He  also told me about that place called Lighthouse over there, which is  a really fun and powerful wave. He also talked about some other place  called Secrets. That spot is scary because it's so shallow. He  mentioned that time when he caught an 8-foot-face wave and rode  it until the end, without realizing that he was in 1 foot of  water!

Caught perhaps 20 waves, all of them fun. The vibe in  the line-up was friendly and professional, which was great. There were  a couple of Dutch/German tourists who didn't know what they were doing  and had eyes as big as saucers when big sets were coming. There were  in the way of many people, but not in mine, somehow. Some guy was sort of  dominating the outside for a while. He had the place completely wired  and he caught all the bigger waves for 1h+.  <li> At the beginning of the session I stayed to the left of the pack, and  somehow I caught a bunch of nice chest-high rights. Then there was a  1/2 hour with no real waves and I surfed the inside a bit, and the  last 45 minutes was great. I surfed pretty well today. All my take-offs  were good. The wave has some power, but it was still a longboard wave.  The spot closer to the lighthouse (Mansions?) seemed more like a  shortboard wave.  <li> In those last 45 minutes I had two great rides that really stood  out. One of head-high set, this older local took off as usual. He had  this uncanny way of always looking like he wasn't going to get into  the wave and then somehow making it. I decided to go left and I paddled  for it. I must have been 1 foot away from him and we made eye contact  and it was clear that he was going right and I was going left. I was  being respectful because the right was much better than the left. But  then, that left starting walling up and after the first section I  cross-stepped almost to the nose and found myself right in the curl,  with perfect trim, going over the beautiful coral (don't want to know  how shallow it was). It was really unreal and lasted perhaps 30 yards,  right in the curl the whole time, with the wave breaking on the tail  of the board. Then I kicked out as the section in front of me started  to look like it was closing out. Quite unreal.  <li> 5 minutes later, this big set comes, and somehow I am perfectly  positioned to get it, with nobody in sight. I drop in and it's  P-E-R-F-E-C-T. It was slightly overhead and I maintained a  mid-face line on the first section. The drop and my view of the wave  was just like you see in surf movies. Unreal. It was peeling  nicely and I managed to get on a higher line, do a cut-back,  and then get on the high-line again setting up for a bottom turn.  That bottom turn was probably the fastest I've gone on a  surfboard in a controlled manner. Then I kept surfing it to the  inside, cross-stepping a bit and just still not believing how  good that wave was. I paddled back out and the guys were like  "nice one" to which I could only grin. I was really overwhelmed  for 5 minutes and fell like diving under water and screaming  "DUDE" or something. After 15 minutes, I caught a small wave in,  dropped on my stomach on the board and rode the white all the way  in. What a session. And I can tell that today was "nothing" and  that it can be MUCH better. If the tide had been a foot lower I  think it would have blown my mind. </ul></blockquote>

The two biggest had about 9ft faces and  a few guys dropped in nicely. Only few guys had good rides though,  the rest of us had a terribly hard time getting into the waves. Only  the bigger sets were breaking and overcoming the chop. So there  was no real middle ground: the only rideable waves for 6+ft faces.  <li> I caught 3 waves total, but didn't catch a single one for the first  45 minutes!  I caught two lefts and two rights, all were hell to  get into, 6ft faces, and both lined up nicely.  <li> On some of the bigger waves I really messed up by pulling out or by  falling on the take-off. The chop and the wind made it so much harder  to focus on what I had to do.  <li> I got caught inside of a bomb and had to ditch the board and  dive. I stayed under quite a bit, being dragged by the leash for  over 20 yards. Was happy to come back up.  <li> There was current and we had to paddle constantly. It really felt  like being out at sea and there was some primal beauty in it all.  <li> I think that I really need to get used to surfing in choppy/windy  big conditions. On one wave I was bouncing to much down the face that  I fell. Basically I should have negotiated the bumps carefully as  opposed to thinking that I could just absorb them with my knees.  <li> Mike brought his roommate's dog, Makalani (heavenly eyes).

 <li> Paradise, 5:45AM-8:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> by myself, alone at first and then up to 15 people out  <li> Mostly glassy, knee- to waist-high faces, and the occasional  chest-high set coming every 1/2 hours.  <li> Long pleasant sessions. Caught about 25 rides, most of them  on the inside. Was in position for two of the bigger sets. On the  first set I was alone on the wave and I had a great ride on a  long right. On the second wave there was a guy on my right and I  tried to take off straight although I was closer to the peak. I  ate it and I could have made it at a steeper angle. On the  bigger sets people just sort of took off without mush regard  for right-of-way rules. As I was paddling out at some point I saw  6 guys take off on a chest-high wave all within a foot from each  other. But the vibe was all about having fun and there was no  aggressiveness really.  <li> On one of the bigger waves I was on the inside and there was this  haole guys I'd seen before and who'd been a sitting duck all  morning, unable to catch a wave. I was about 10 ft behind him and  as I started preparing to turtle roll I noticed that he was  setting up hi board parallel to the incoming breaking wave. I  just had the time to think "what the hell?", turtled, and when I  came back up his board was 1/2 a foot from mine. Of course he'd  lost it. Unbelievable. That guy leaves here and has been surfing  for years (based on conversations in the line-up). I couldn't believe  he could do something SO stupid. I payed attention to him for the whole  session. He did not catch a wave in 2.5 hours. He would paddle with  both arms at the same time, and then spread his arms apart as if he  was smoothly going down the face and preparing to take-off. The  problem is that he was never giving that last stroke that would  allow him to go down the face. It was unreal. All the locals were  talking to him like he was an old timer, etc.  <li> I talked to quite a few people in the line-up, with most  conversations started by the fact that I was riding a Stewart.  Guys started asking me about California surfing. They were all  totally into Rincon. Good thing I had surfed it once 6 months ago  so that I could sort of provide a good story. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Paradise, 5:45AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> paddled out with Paula, met Jim, Doug, and his friend Ann in the  line-up, 2-3 other people out.  <li> A bit windy, not very consistent, but a few waist-high waves coming  through with higher peaks, as usual with Paradise .  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with a few good take-offs on rights. Nothing  to write home about.  <li> Surfed the inside between Threes and Paradise with Paula a little bit  but it was just a small peak with short rides. We saw tons of  sea urchins ("Wana", pronounced "Vah-na", which refers in fact to  toxic sea urchins). The days of falling off the board at the end of  the ride are over :) </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Paradise, 5:45AM-8AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> paddled out with Paula to Threes. Met Doug and Ann there, and  after catching a few waves paddled to Paradise where we met Jim,  Edgar, and that guy I hadn't met before, Glen.  <li> Paradise was glassy at first and then a bit windy, not very  consistent but with nice sets coming through, shoulder high on the  peak and chest-high walls for the best ones. I went back and forth  between the spot where Jim, Edgar, and Glen were and the spot where  Doug, Ann, and Paula had stayed, closer the threes.  <li> I caught about 20 rides overall, with a few really fun take-offs.  <li> After everybody went home I was left alone with Glen and we talked.  Really nice guy. He was a beach boy in the 50's and he owns a  business taking tourists on tours of the neighboring islands. He  told me exactly where to sit at Paradise to be in the right spot,  which was really helpful. We talked about California surfing in cold  water. Overall a very nice guy whom I hope to see again. He only  surfs paradise for the rush of the drop on big days. He said it feels  like Sunset Beach on bigger swells. There is a swell tomorrow and I  may try to catch it before flying out to So Cal.  <li> Glenn told me about his friend who took off on a hollow left at  Paradise at low tide, fell of the board in the shallows, and  stepped on a wana. He had to have the spines surgically removed, had  several infections, etc. Good thing I spotted them earlier and  was wary of them.  <li> Many rainbows </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 5:45AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> paddled out with Jim, Doug, and a friend of Doug's. Met Paula  in the line-up, and later Edgar and some other guys. There were  about 20 other people at the peak.  <li> Glassy at times, windy at times, not very consistent with rather long  lulls. Most sets were chest-high on the drop and the had waist+ high  walls, many of them really well lined-up. A few bigger sets.  <li> The conditions were clearly not as good as what the forecast had  said and there were too many people for too few waves. Several  shortboarders who were on the inside. I heard a few of them say  that they should've gone to the North Shore. Unclear given that the  current swell on the North Shore is so messy from what I hear.  <li> Caught perhaps 20 rides, with 2 great lefts, some of the bigger  ones. Especially one that was lined up all the way to the inside  and on which I was able to hit the lip a couple times, right in  the pocket. Really fun. I had several other good rides.  <li> I'd say I caught more wave than the average guy out there although  I had to back off on quite a few not to drop in on people. Really  friendly atmosphere out there though, really pleasant, beautiful  weather, rainbows.  <li> Off to San Diego in a few hours, slated to surf there in the morning.  I'll probably die in the cold water. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Ab, 7AM-9:30AM, high tide at 5AM  <li> on Dario's 9'  <li> paddled out with Holly, Bucky, Shawn and his friend Jen. Nobody out  for 1.5 hour, and then 3 young guys paddled out. They had asked  me questions about the place in the parking lot and were all about  knowing the name of all the spots. good thing I have them down pat  now (stop laughing Dario).  <li> The tide was too high at first but I made the call for the  Cliffs rather than Mission as Mission was already closing out at  knee-high. As expected, the conditions at the Cliffs improved  steadily as the tide dropped.  <li> Almost glassy, inconsistent, at first knee-high and at the end  a few sets at shoulder-high on the take-off and waist-high  walls. Not as good as Ab can be, but still pretty fun.  <li> Between the board that doesn't paddle nearly as good as my 9'2'' and  the wetsuit that I was borrowing and that was too small, paddling  was a bit of a challenge. But I still caught about 30 waves, with  2-3 nice lefts an a surprisingly nice right as well. Really fun out  there and it was good being in the water with Holly again  <li> I tried Bucky's board for a bit while he was sitting on Dario's  board. That board is really fun and I had 3 fun rides on it. Sort  of narrow, pointy nose, very loose as well. Not the right board  for him at all it turns out, but really fun for me.  <li> Overall a great session. Sunset Cliffs always delivers.  Beautiful  weather.  <li> Met Roland at Charlie's house and he said the surf was really  going to pick up tomorrow. With very high tide at 6AM I'll try to  surf in front of the house. There should be some corners. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> La Jolla Shores, 2:30PM-3:30PM, low tide at 1PM  <li> on a 9' rental epoxy Bic board.  <li> with Eddy. About 30 people out.  <li> Just went for a laugh while Eddy was in town for this conference  I was organizing. This was during the time for the "excursion".  <li> Horrible conditions.  Choppy. Foggy. Cold. Inconsistent. Waist-high close-outs. The works.  <li> Caught 4 rides that consisted of a scary take-off 10 yards from the  shore, a quick bottom turn, and a jump back over the wave in 3ft  of water. Quite ridiculous.  <li> There was a mean-looking shortboarder out with no wetsuit and tattoos  everywhere. I feel like I had seen him before actually.  <li> 2 dolphins 10 yards away from us in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, Cliffs, 6AM-8AM,  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> by myself. Up to 20 other people out.  <li> First session after a 2-week hiatus.  <li> Glassy, knee- to waist-high with a few occasional chest-high sets,  inconsistent but clean and organized.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with 2 or 3 quite fun. Nice way to get back  into things.  <li> On the way out it was pitch black, and this girl was getting OUT of  the water. This guy said he saw her every morning here, surfing by  herself at night. Can you say hard-core? </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, Cliffs, 6AM-8AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> by myself. Up to 25 other people out.  <li> Glassy, waist-high with a few chest-high sets, not as consistent  as on Monday, but really good shape when sets came in.  <li> Caught 4 extra fun rides (all rights) during the first 45 minutes,  long, with a nice wall to work on. Then caught another 10 or so rides  as the conditions deteriorated a bit.  <li> The sunrise was absolutely beautiful and I realized that one can  see Maui from the spot. Talked to a few people in the water. Definitely  a mellow atmosphere out there.  <li> On one ride, probably my best one, I did a semi late take-off. nothing  sketchy, but a couple years back I probably couldn't have made it. That  guy who surfs with amazing style (I think I've mentioned him before)  paddled back out and told me: "Nice wave dude!!" That was sort of  unexpected. We talked a bit and he said "see you tomorrow" on the  way out. Really friendly and fun, and an incredible surfer.  <li> Some of the conversation in the water was about sharks. Some guy said  he was surfing on the leeward side and a 8ft shark went right by  him in the water. The guy was like: "I guess he just wasn't  interested". </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 6AM-8AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> with Jim, Edgar, and Ron. Nobody else out  <li> Ultra glassy, knee- to waist-high, with one shoulder-high set,  inconsistent. Amazing sunrise.  <li> A very dreamy session, with ultra glassy perfect small waves. Caught  about 20 rides, with 3 or 4 just beautiful ones.  <li> Some of the rides were just picture perfect, with a smooth  take-off, low on my knees, bottom turning towards Diamond Head with  the rising sun reflecting off the glass, the wave lining up.  Slightly blinded by the sun I would go to a higher line as if in a  dream, then straighten my legs and arch back a little bit as the  wave is peeling on my thighs. Then,  go down for the second  bottom turn while looking at the coral bottom before looking  at the molten glass again. I had about 3 such rides, and my  last one was one of them, on a slightly bigger and more lined-up  wave. During these rides it really hit me hard that surfing is a  truly beautiful and soulful thing to do. It's just too bad that  trying to describe why it's beautiful and soulful invariably  makes you sound like some new-agey pontificating  pseudo-philosopher poser.  <li> 1 sea turtle in the line-up </ul></blockquote>

I made a bad call when reading the wave  and he was sort of an asshole about it after I apologized about it.  I had never seen the guy before and I guess he was pissed because  he hadn't been catching any wave.  <li> Beautiful sunrise on Diamond Head. </ul></blockquote>

Caught about 10 waves, with only one that  could really qualify as a ride.  <li> Nice sunrise and conversations with people out there, so still  nice to be in the water. Maybe tomorrow I'll try Diamond Head. </ul></blockquote>

That would be great. Although it's difficult  for me to go work-wise, I'll try to go to the NS once a week perhaps,  unless it's huge. I hope it works out. </ul></blockquote>

A few knee-high peaks.  <li> Paddled out at night under stunning moonlight and went to Threes.  Caught one "wave" there. Paddled over to Paradise and saw a sea  turtle on the way. It was still night, but I heard it breathe pretty  loudly, which was weird.  <li> Once at Paradise, couldn't catch anything, so I paddled to Pops.  I figured that I may as well get a work out of of this. There  was one guy out at Pops, not very friendly. We didn't see a single  wave come by in 20 minutes.  <li> Then I paddled to Canoes, caught a wave there, and came back to Pops,  then to Paradise where I met up with Ron and Jim. We talked a bit.  Ron caught the only two waves and went in.  <li> Jim and I then paddled to Threes where Jim caught his last wave.  I tried to wait for my last wave, but gave up and paddled in.  <li> It's my last day before being off to Europe so I had to get wet. It  was just completely beautiful out there, moonlight, stunning sunrise,  glassy water, etc. </ul></blockquote>
