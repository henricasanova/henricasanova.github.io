 <li> Paradise, Threes 6:20AM-7:45AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> Paddled out at the crack of dawn under a nice moonlight.  <li> Went to Threes but that tide was too high and it didn't seem  to work, so I paddled over to Paradise. There were two guys out,  who turned out to be Nate and Robin, whom Glen introduced to me when  he paddled out a little bit after.  <li> Conditions were glassy, not consistent, with a few nice sets  coming through, chest-high on the peak and then not much of a wall.  <li> Caught 1 very good wave with, somehow, a good chest-high wall.  Tons  of fun. Caught a couple more, nothing to write home about. After  chatting with Glen for a while I spotted Doug, Jim, and Ron at  Threes and paddled over. I stayed there for 1/2 hour, catching  2-3 waves, nowhere nearly as good as the ones at Paradise,  although Ron caught a very good one. Mitch paddled out, and  I paddled in shortly afterwards.  <li> Overall a "still getting back into things" session, with not many  waves but as usual a great vibe in the ocean.  <li> Doug had his waterproof digital camera and he took pictures. Hopefully  he'll send one to me. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head 6:30-7:45  <li> on my 9'2'', by myself. 6 other people out. The usual crew.  <li> Moderate to strong side trades, not very consistent but nice sets  coming through. Only the bigger sets would break. Head-high take-offs  and then chest to shoulder high rides. A few occasional bigger sets.  The smaller waves just wouldn't break due to the wind and the high  tide.  <li> Caught 6 rides, with 2 good lefts and 1 good right. At the end of  the right I had somebody in my line and I ended up falling.  This was really my fault because I wasn't able to generate much  speed. The wind just makes things so much more difficult, requiring  more strength and more skill. Some of those guys are really unreal in  those conditions, as if the bumps on the waves don't bother them  at all. I think I am still not low enough on my knees perhaps. Anyway,  I was pretty happy with a couple of sketchy take-offs at the bottom  of which I was right at the limit of pearling and managed to make  the turn pretty well.  <li> Good session overall, much bigger than Waikiki, and windier. The  usual.  Not sure where I'll go tomorrow, especially because the  high tide will really make Threes not work well. Perhaps Diamond Head  again. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head 6:20-7:30  <li> on my 7'6'', by myself. 6 other people out. The usual crew.  <li> Well, the forecast predicted an increase in size, so, in spite of  the high tide I opted to take my 7'6'' out for the first time  since I've moved to Hawai`i. Turned out that the winds were  stronger than yesterday, and the the waves were smaller. So not  a good call. Strong side trades getting stronger throughout the  session, biggest waves coming through  at chest-high, but very junky, bumpy, crumbly.  <li> Nevertheless it felt good to paddle out on my 7'6''. I was paddling  as fast as the longboarders (around the line-up that is), because it  really cuts through the chop much better than my long board. Catching  waves was more of a challenge. I caught two on the inside, which  were nothing special. I guess it was good to see that I can still  pop up on this board and not be completely off balance.  Everybody  had a really hard time. And we had to paddle East constantly because  the trades made us drift rather fast. So quite a nice workout.  <li> The sunrise was outstanding and walking on the beach back to the  shower was quite something. Such a beautiful place. I sat there for  5 minutes just taking it all in. The wind was so strong by that time  that I had a hard time carrying my board. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Paradise, 6:20-7:50  <li> on my 9'2'', met Ron in the line-up, two other guys out, and  two spongers (what were they thinking?)  <li> The tide was high and only paradise was working, for some definition  of "working". knee- to waist-high, totally glassy, inconsistent,  the few occasional peaks.  <li> Caught about 10 rides, with only 2 that were decent.  <li> Beautiful morning out there, so nice to be back in the water  after a week of under-the-weatherness. Could use more waves.  <li> There was a lull toward the end of the session and I had to  paddle in without really catching a wave. There was this kook  out there you, on what could've been my last wave, did a  "I am going... I am not going... I am going..." number, which  caused me to pull out. I made it back to my car at 8:05 without  a parking ticket though. </ul></blockquote>

All this in spit of the high tide. Diamond  Head seems like it always has something going.  <li> Nice vice in the water, beautiful sunrise. I think I am going  to buy an epoxy board after talking to one of the guys there. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Paradise and then Threes, 7:20-8:45  <li> on my 9'2'', with Mike  <li> Decided to paddle out there for the hell of it. Not glassy but  not windy. Very inconsistent with the occasional thigh-high set.  After catching one wave there, we paddled to Threes. Threes  was better. Caught two waves there only because there were two  guys there dominating the line-up. One of them dropped on me, but  not in an outrageous way. They were quite on top of their game and  had a wonderful eye.  <li> It was great to go out there and I feel stronger and stronger.  Finally getting back into some type of shape. </ul></blockquote>

No wind though.  <li> I rented this board to see if I wanted to buy it, so I had  to take it out although the conditions were rather dismal. On  a long board it would have been "ok" I guess, but on this it  wasn't great.  <li> Overall I popped up on the board perhaps 6 times, with only one  of them being an actual ride.  <li> I have pretty much decided not to go for this board because it's  too close to my 7'6'' in the way it feels and responds. what I am  really looking for is an 8'2''-8'4'' round/pin tail. That's going  to be hard to find I think. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, 6:30-8:00  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> waist- to shoulder-high  <li> Not very consistent but nice shape, glassy, 20 people out  <li> Didn't catch too many rides. 5 total. The crowd was a factor  and only one peak was somewhat consistent. I caught two very nice  rights on the inside.  <li> On my last wave in I may have dropped in on some guy who was jockeying  for position. It really wasn't clear at all as I went right and  the wave was more of a left, so I thought I was being nice. But I  think he meant to go right for some reason. The wave closed out  on the right right away anyway. I hate these unclear situations.  I started paddling for the wave earlier as I was further out. He  was initially on my right, but went around the front of my board  to be on my left and therefore have the right-of-way on a right,  although I thought all along it was a left. Perhaps I was wrong.  Anyway, no harm done. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2006_Feb_24">Fri 24 Feb 2006</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Pops, 8:00-10:00  <li> on my 9'2'', with Cecile and Jon, 20+ other people out  <li> waist- to head-high, very clean, a few lulls.  <li> Surfed mostly the inside with them trying to tech them a bit, but  it was hard. Caught perhaps 10 waves there overall. A few surprisingly  fun ones. Cecile had a very hard time with the paddling, which is to  be expected of course. job stood up 3-4 times. It's SO hard to teach  somebody on their first session. Also, she kept staying by the side  of her board and hitting the coral with her feet, which sort of  sucked.  <li> I went to the line-up to try to catch one wave. A big one came and  I was in position, with only one guy between me and the peak. He was  further out and it wasn't clear that he was going to get in. I kept  looking at him, and I lost my focus a little bit. When he didn't make  it I tried to pull in but I couldn't quite make it and I was just  raised by the wave, at the top of a head-high face. At that moment  I saw a guy right in front of me. At that point I couldn't make it  down the face at all. I tried to keep my board but ended up  losing it. Unfortunately, the tip of my board hit his on the  bottom, making a pretty nasty ding in it. It was totally my fault  although it wasn't a horribly kookish thing to do given the  situation. The guy was kind of pissed of course, and I apologized  profusely offering to pay for the ding repair. He told me where  he worked and I told him I'd bring him money at his work around  lunch time. He started totally mellowing out, saying "hey, if you  pay for it, it's all good".  His name was Kaweka, a bellman at  the Reef hotel. I went there around 1PM, thinking of giving him  $50. I had to wait for him a little bit and when he showed up he  was BLOWN AWAY that I had showed up. He literally couldn't  believe it, shook my hand like 100 times, asked me for $50, which  I gave him right away. We then talked for 10-20 minutes, and he  had a relapse of gratitude, running after me in the street to  shake my hand again. It was such an Aloha moment it was  sickening. I really hope I see him in the line-up. He's a totally  amazing surfer. Seeing his board all dinged up was really, really  sad. Such a nice board. Oh well, I really felt terrible about the  whole thing but now I guess I have a great friend among the Pops  locals. And he was totally saying that the "accident" really  wasn't horribly kookish and it was a sketchy situation. </ul></blockquote>

It was Jiah's 2nd or 3rd  session and she never  reached the line-up.  <li> Caught about 25 rides, with 5 of them really fun toward the end  of the session.

 <li> Diamond Head, 6:30AM-8AM  <li> on my 9'2''. Met John in the water, 6-7 people out  <li> glassy, no wind, not very consistent, many doubles and rather  fat waves with a peak but not much of a wall. Biggest peaks  at head high and most of them at shoulder-high. The few walls  were waist to chest.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with a lot of them having the wave dying out,  but two outstanding rights with a very nice wall, going forever  all the way to the inside. Another one was a great drop followed  by a powerful bottom turn. For once I managed to really accelerate  on my board and I escaped from a close-out section by going over  the back of the wave, jumping really high above the wave. That was  quite a thrill actually.  <li> I opted to surf closer to the inside, with John, which turned out to  be a much better option. It was only he and I there. People on  the outside failed to catch to many waves, and by sitting 20 yards  inside we had our pick.  <li> Great vibe in the water, good conversation with John.  <li> Very nice sunrise. </ul></blockquote>

By myself. nobody out.  <li> glassy, not consistent, waist-high.  <li> I made the call for Waikiki instead  of DH, which probably was a mistake. First paddled to Threes and  it was a mixed-up mess. I caught one pseudo-wave and after 20 minutes  I paddled to Paradise. Paradise was much better, not consistent,  but as usual a clean peak. Not much of a wall, which is usual  too. Caught about 15 rides, with only one that walled up decently  and connected to the inside. Quite a few fun drops though. It's really  amazing how even in the absence of a swell this place manages to create  a peak.  <li> One sea turtle in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

Met Doug and John at Threes. 15 people out.  <li> almost glassy, shoulder- to 2-feet-overhead high, consistent although  sometimes a bit mixed up with multiple peaks.  <li> First paddled out to Paradise as from the beach Threes didn't  look good. Caught one nice wave there, with a head+-high drop  and a little bit of a wall. From Paradise I saw that Threes  was working and I decided to paddled over.  <li> By the time I got to Threes there were 10 people out and it peaked  at 15 or so. Very nice waves, but the crowd made it a bit difficult  to sit right on the peak (for me, that is). I caught perhaps  10 waves a bit off to the Ewa side of the pack, with 2 or 3 that  were quite nice with cool drops. Many times I couldn't make it  through the section on the rights because I was not taking off  on the main peak. Had a few nice lefts. The inside was kind of  a mess and the paddle back proved to be quite the workout on a couple  of occasions. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, 6:30AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 7'6''. 9 other people out  <li> Talked to a guy before getting in the water. He told me that  conditions were epic on Friday. In fact, he couldn't get out as  there is no channel there, and bruised the hell out of his arm  when his skegs hit him during a failed turtle roll. Good thing  I went to Threes that day.  <li> Choppy, strong side trades, waves breaking all over the place  with bigger ones with shoulder-high faces, although I hesitate  calling those things faces.  <li> This is the curse of the 7'6''. I have never surfed that board in  nice conditions. I caught 4 rides, with 2 sort of ok. But it was  really hard to get into those bumpy waves and I was really wishing  I had taking my 9'2'' out.  <li> There is something satisfying about being in a messy ocean  though. At some point it even sprinkled, with chop everywhere,  strong wind.  It felt like we were really in the middle of the  ocean.  <li> I had to surf the inside and there were those 4 guys who were beginner.  At some point one of them paddled in front of me, and this set came. We  all had to turtle roll although it was a weak/crumbly wave. He lost his  board, and somehow hit mine, although I was not directly behind  him. I could tell it was going to be bad because his board was at  an angle and not straight out to sea. It made quite a dent in my  board, and at that point I was just "ok, this is it, I am paddling  in". I could have tried to get some money from him, but I didn't have  the energy. Besides, he messed up his epoxy board pretty bad. He was  like: "woohoo!! That was a big one". To which I said: "No it wasn't.  You're not supposed to lose your board like that. it's very  dangerous."  <li> While I was packing up by the side of the road, this lady jogged by  and shouted at me "God loves you!". Quite surreal ending to this  pretty lame session. </ul></blockquote>

Very  little wind.  <li> Caught about 10 rides with a couple pretty fun.  <li> A few bigger waves were coming through, and at some point I was  in the impact zone with another guy. We both attempted to turtle  and both lost our boards. Just the wrong place at the wrong time.  When we cam up, there was foam on the surface, and then I saw  a piece of his board floating by!! Unbelievable. His board had been  cleanly snapped in half. The wave wasn't that huge at all, but I  guess it hit the board right in the wrong spot.  <li> At some point, I was paddling back from a ride and this guy  caught the white water. He came toward me and unbelievably hit by  board.  That was so insanely stupid. 3 minor dings, but that made  it through the fiber glass and thus need repair. He said he'd pay  for the damage, but I guess we had a misunderstanding and after  exchanging a few nasty e-mails it turned out that he thought it  was my fault because the people paddling out are supposed to get  out of the wave of the people riding the white wash in! So  anyway, he offered to buy me a ding repair kit, which I declined.  This is really sad because now he truly thinks I was trying to  rip him off.  <li> I guess this qualifies as an eventful session. </ul></blockquote>

Of course I really felt  out of it in the water, but perhaps surprisingly not so weak. I just  felt unsure on the board and my timing was off several times.

Taking off is definitely a  different experience than on the 9'2'', much closer in feel  to my 7'7''.  <li> I caught one semi-close out wave that was about 1ft overhead and  made quite a sketchy drop by pushing hard on the from of the board.  It was a very short ride but making that drop pretty confirms that  this board is going to be challenging, but not so much that it  won't be fun to ride.  <li> The biggest challenge will be to have my feet well positioned as  I pop up.  <li> All in all I caught about 6 rides, which wasn't bad given that the  conditions were quite challenging (got caught on the inside a couple  time too) </ul></blockquote>

Some sets were perfectly lined-up an some were  closing out on the lefts.  <li> Caught about 10 rides, with only 2 rights because the competition  to go right was a bit intense.  <li> This board is quite outstanding. I had a couple of great rides  and the board is so responsive and fast, and yet catching wave isn't  a complete struggle. I did a few good take-offs, and a few that were  on the inside that I completely botched. I fell twice on the take-off,  which hadn't happened to me in a while on my other board.

Moved to the next peak over.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, a bit windy. That wave definitely pitches and is more  challenging than Threes or Diamond Head. Glad I had by 8'2''.  <li> Caught about 10 rides, with 1 great right, and one ok left. Other  than that I was never in a great position, ending up taking off  on small sections that would close out. Still a good experience.  Towards the end of the session it seems I couldn't really get into  any decent waves and I just paddled in.  <li> That place is cool, but I don't have what it takes to compete with  the pack by the best peak, and the reef is ultra-shallow on the  inside (hit the reef with my hand while paddling back to the  line-up). </ul></blockquote>

Up to 30 people out at the end of the session.  <li> Glassy, chest-high to 2ft overhead, clean, perfect  <li> Caught about 10 rides, with a great left and a good right. The  rest were lefts that were really fun on the take-off but sort  of closing out. The problem was that the competition for the rights  was a bit too much, so I opted for inside lefts. Still fun though.  <li> Mahdi made it to the line-up but then couldn't really make  it back  out. It was his first session in 5 months. </ul></blockquote>

So Dario and I paddled to chasm,  where it was much better (and bigger as well).  <li> Caught about 10 rides, with a great right on a perfect A frame, with  Dario catching a great left. Caught a few other good ones, always  with decent size and shape.  <li> I was really having trouble with the different board, the  different wave, the wetsuit on, etc. Such a difference from surfing  Threes two days ago. But as the session went on things went a bit  better. Would have be better to have a leash probably. </ul></blockquote>

From 10 to  2 and back to 10 people out.  <li> Not very consistent but nice waist-high waves coming through  once and again. From glassy to slightly windy.  <li> First session after about 2 months of interruption! It was so great  to get back in the water. Somehow, paddling wasn't as bad as I thought  and although I wasn't in the best shape I was able to paddle for  2 hours. The current was pushing us towards Diamond Head and we had  to paddle pretty much constantly to stay in position.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with 3-4 very fun, all rights. Beautiful  water and weather, nice vibe in the line-up. Just great.  <li> Finally talked at length and introduced myself to Clarence, that  retired Chinese guy I had seen surfing with his friend before. Total  locals and extremely friendly. We talked for about 20 minutes.  <li> Paddled back in after catching a little wave in. Walked to the car  in the parking lot feeling 100% happy, great flowery smell in the  air, perfect temperature, light breeze. And in fact I was so happy  and content that I proceeded to lock myself out of the car. That's  my new motto: "I shall lock myself out of my car once a year".  Called AAA from a cellphone, bought Longboard magazine and waited  in the shade of a big tree until the guy came to save me. Surprisingly  a great way to end a session instead of just rushing off to work. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, 5:30AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> by myself. Met Will and Meiko in the line-up.  <li> Tried to go to Threes but the parking situation has become  (temporarily) insane there. There is construction  right near  Saratoga and many parking spots have been removed and the  parking people are ticketing starting at 7AM as opposed to  8AM. So one has to go into the parking lot, which has gotten  more expensive. Everything will be back to normal once the  construction stops, but right now it sucks. I think I'll start  parking on the Ala Wai and then walk over, which shouldn't be  too bad really. But this morning, in spite of the trades, I  opted to drive on to Diamond Head.  <li> Diamond Head was not very consistent and not organized, plus it  was quite bumpy and choppy due to the trades. Really hard to  get into most of the waves. Bigger sets were in the head-high  range though.  <li> Caught 5 waves, and to be honest, they were surprisingly good. It  seems that many Diamond Head sessions are like this: after the  session in the same breath you say "it was a mess out there" and  "man, those waves I caught were great!". Exactly what happened today.  The waves I caught were all in the chest- shoulder-high range,  rights, really lines-up and allowing for several maneuvers, fast,  powerful, just really fun with not-too-sketchy take-offs. </ul></blockquote>

Easy take-offs, followed by a fast section makable only on a pretty  high line, and then lined up all the way to the inside with a great  wall for maneuvering. Really amazing rides.  <li> On the biggest wave of the day I was sort of alone outside and I tried  a turn-and-burn. Not sure what happened. The take-off was steep, but  not that steep, and I just fell off the board. I didn't take off at  at steep enough angle. That was sort of lame and the wave was totally  wasted. All the guys out were like: "Duuuuuuuude".  <li> In spite of that wave, I felt that my style on the rights was  pretty good today, with my hand in the wall on bottom turns, etc.  Odd to be surfing decently after a 2.5 months interruption.  <li> about 8 dolphins outside, and a few whales on the horizon. </ul></blockquote>

Not  consistent at all with super long hulls and waves didn't have  much power. Very much the wrong board for the conditions.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with only a couple that were really  fun. Feet position on this board is really important, and when  they are well positioned the board works extremely well. Still  need a bit of adjustment, and unfortunately today really wasn't  the best day to try things out.

Sort of mushy and disorganized  although it wasn't really windy, which is why I opted for DH  this morning.  <li> Really difficult to get into waves and not really fun unless one  caught one of the rogue set waves. But of course these waves were  owned by the local longboarders sitting on the outside. So  pretty tough for me on the inside really, with many doubles, etc.  <li> Caught 4 waves, with only one left that was fun. I could have had  a good right but the take-off was super steep and although it looked  like I was going to make it I ended up falling into the face of the  wave.  <li> Pretty much spent the entire session wishing I had my 9'2'', which  sort of sucks really.

Totally  glassy, pretty consistent in the waist- to chest-high range,  totally clean.  <li> Caught about 25 waves, mostly rights, with a lot of them quite fun.  Still doing the hand in the water thing. Really odd. Not sure that  I am doing it in good style at all.  <li> A very crowded day at Threes, but I hung out on the inside with  Jim and I caught many nice waves, mostly rights as usual. The funny  thing is that at the same time I felt like I was just surfing  leftovers, but objectively speaking if these had been outside waves  the session would still had qualified as totally fun. Luckily, only  a few people opted for surfing the inside and there was almost no  competition.  <li> Of course, the downside of surfing the inside is that you  have  to do something when a big wave comes on the outside and 5 guys  are paddling for it. Overall it wasn't too bad although I had a few  close encounters. What complicated things is that there was quite  a bit of dropping in today on the outside. Sort of shocking at times:  three guys on a wave, all good surfers, the guys in front not really  bailing. Everybody feels that they deserve beautiful Threes waves. In  particular there was this local girl who just didn't care and  dropped in no matter what.  <li> There were a few people who didn't really belong out there, and  especially this one guy who was clearly a beginner, with perhaps  1 year of surfing behind him, if that. On a chest-high wave he  dropped in on that guy in a pretty outrageous way, got on his knees,  went straight, and then pitched forward and rolled into the white.  Their two boards collided quite violently (we heard them from like  20 yards away!) and they could have been hurt as they were  entangled together, in the white water. Luckily it wasn't a very  powerful wave. It was horrible to watch and we all saw it  coming... just as I was in the middle of telling Jim "Look.... is  that guy going to...  NO WAY!" it all happened. I used to be that  guy, but at least I didn't paddle out at Threes when there is a  swell when I was him. </ul></blockquote>

Super glassy and clean, but  not extremely consistent, with long lulls. One of the peaks was  breaking much better than the others but had of course tougher  competitions.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple head-high ones that were  fun.  Was happy to have my 9'2'' as getting in the wave required quite  a bit of effort; they were fat and slowly building. Didn't catch  any of the really good ones, but had tons of fun.  <li> The weather was unreal today, absolutely beautiful, with sunrise over  Koko Head, and perfectly glassy water (which I don't think I've ever  seen at Diamond Head).  <li> Back up to the car I had what I'll call a "Dog Shit Encounter".  In fact, although I didn't mention it in my surf report this past  Tuesday, I had a DSE then. Right before getting to the car, which was  parked on the Ala Wai, I stepped in dog shit on the grass. I am talking  between the toes and all. After the initial shock, I managed to  clean up with water and soap (which I always have in the car),  but I guess the damage to my psyche was too great and I left my  rashguard on a bench. That wasn't too bad as I was overdue for a  new one, but still. And today, only 3 days later, when laying down  my board bag on the sidewalk I apparently put it down on another pile  of dogshit because when I picked it up it was covered with it, and  so were my boardshorts. ARGHHH!!! I managed to sacrifice a towel and  clear the bag up with water, and remove my trunks without dogshit  contact. As I write this they are in the trunk of the car, probably  becoming a new life form. I just had no energy to deal with this  immediately. So, I don't know, two DSE in 4 days seems is a little bit  disturbing after many years of DSE-less surfing. Good thing that  it was a beautiful and fun session. </ul></blockquote>

The local older guys seem really fun, but really,  they are lost in such a huge crowd. Unbelievably, even today  there were the usual Japanese tourists on tiny boards in the  line-up.  Guys on 12ft boards had trouble getting into waves, and  these guys are sitting out there on their potato chips. I really  don't get this. I guess they fly to Hawaii, get a hotel on  Waikiki, and paddle out on the board they brought with them on  the plane, and are happy to sit in the water for hours without  ever the hint of a wave they could catch.

 <li> Threes and then Pops, 5:30AM-7AM  <li> on my 8'2''. Paddled out with Doug. 5 other people out when I left  Threes. About 20 at Pops.  <li> Chest- to head-high, with a few overhead sets, a bit windy but  not too bumpy, perfect shapes, long waits but worth it.  <li> Caught 5 rights and 1 left at Threes, and then 2 lefts at Pops.  <li> It was only Doug and I for about 15 minutes, basically in the  dark, trying to figure out whether conditions were any good or not.  There was a lot of white water, so that was a good sign on the  paddle out.  <li> I first caught a small right that wasn't anything special at all  and after that nothing for a while, and it was 3 of us in the line-up.  <li> Right when we started saying "are there any waves?", this set  loomed over the horizon (it was daylight by then), and looked to  be definitely overhead. Doug was a little bit too far off the  peak while I was right on it. I heard him say "Go! Go!!" and I  dropped in. I had to push like crazy on the nose of the board to  make the drop and I locked into a high line after a fast bottom  turn. The waved walled up and looking up I could see the lip about  two feet above my head with this beautiful wall going all the way down  the line. It was the first time I surfed my 8'2'' in good  conditions and it worked amazingly well. I would never had made  these sections on my longboard, but there I just flew down the  line, going faster that I had ever gone on a surf board. At some  point I got buried in white water and emerged super fast to see  that there was still a very long head-high wall ahead. Starting  pumping up and down the face, going super fast. Luckily my  position on the board was perfect so I didn't have to readjust my  feet at any point, which has always been my big problem. After many  cutbacks and going through super fast sections on the inside (on his  previous wave Doug had warned be that the inside was very fast),  I finally kicked the board out. It felt like I had just made an insane  drop (well, insane for me) and then barely made 20 super fast  sections in a row. Had I stalled on that first section, I could  easily have been barreled according to what Doug could tell. I felt  a huge amount of adrenaline at that point, feeling so excited that  I was actually shaking all over. Pretty funny. I paddled back out  and Doug was like: "dude? Did you make that one???". Definitely the  best wave I've ever surfed in terms of the wave itself and how I  handled it. It took me about 10 minutes to recover and come down  from the whole experience. I realize that some people surf like this  all the time, but hey, nothing like the first time I guess. Then Doug  said something like: "Did you think of the board at all during  the ride?" and I realized I hadn't at all. His point was that  when you go shorter, you just forget that you have a board. And  that's exactly what happened. Arguably, going from 9'2'' to 8'2''  is not really going much shorter, but the shape is so different that  to me it feels very, very different. His point was that when  you've found a board you never think about, then you should keep  it.  <li> I caught 1 left after that which sort of closed out, followed by  3 super fun chest-high rights. Unbelievable how even these  smaller waves were fast and lined up. On one of them I actually  got covered for a split second, and emerged from the white water  with again a beautiful wall ahead. More adrenaline at that point.  <li> At that point, I had surfed 1 OUTSTANDING wave, and 3 great ones,  and I was on such a surf high that I couldn't really sit in  place, let alone wait for the long lulls in between sets. 5 good  longboarders had paddled out, and I decided to leave it at that  rather than deal with even a small crowd. Definitely the "I can  go home after this" feeling. So I paddled over to Pops where Tom  told me he'd be, just to get a work out. I was so pumped that I  paddled super fast. There was a crowd there and the wave was much  mushier and a bunch of older guys on 10 footers owned the place.  I stayed inside, didn't find Tom, paddled around, caught a left  and went to the beach. When I got to the beach I was literally  exhausted, probably due to coming down from it all.  <li> Part of me feels silly about being so excited. Doug caught two  waves as good as the one I got, and he snapped insane off-the-lips  every 2 seconds on each ride, and he was just like "yeah, it's fun  today" while I was jumping up and down on my board next to him :) </ul></blockquote>

Pops had about 20  people out.  <li> waist- to chest-high, with a few head-high sets, a bit windy,  definitely not as good as yesterday.  <li> Still on a high from yesterday session, and not too into it today  given that the "half the waves twice the surfers" combination was  a bit of a downer.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a nice left actually that was (for once)  lined up. Probably around 150 yards on a left, which I've never done  at Threes. Then caught a few inside waves, but nowhere nearly as fun  as yesterday.  <li> After a while, when it go to be 30 people out I just paddled over to  Pops, where I caught one fun right on the inside and then went in  after paddling around the spot a bit. I'll probably take my longboard  tomorrow and come to Pops.  <li> Overall, a really decent day, but yesterday was so special that I  was not too motivated. </ul></blockquote>

About 20 other people out.  <li> Glassy, not consistent with really fat waves, shoulder-high  when breaking.  <li> Somehow Mahdi talked me into an afternoon session, and we went to  what I thought was Queens. I wasn't too into it, but whatever. Turns  out it wasn't Queens it was Publics!! Had I known this I would have  totally said no I think, as Publics is known for being super shallow  and sketchy. Turns out, it was super shallow and sketchy :)  <li> Caught 3 waves, with one of the big lefts, a smaller one on which  I went right (which is not a good idea at Queens as it turns out),  and another smaller left.  <li> The conditions were pretty lame with only the inside breaking and  the outside breaking once every 20 minutes if that. The inside was  packed with local tattooed teenagers on short boards or boogie boards. A few  older longboarders on the outside. Choices were to wait forever on  the outside of fight it out on the inside. I opted for the outside.  <li> Publics is really shallow inside, especially towards the right.  There is this piece of the reef that's pretty much dry on any  kind of wave. I went right on a wave and that's not something one  should do really, given how shallow it is and there is a clear risk of  hitting the reef. I found myself in about 2ft of water, with my leash  stuck in the reef. On a big day that could be really sketchy.  <li> Overall I didn't really have such a good time. I've become a  morning only surfer I guess. I hated paddling back out with the sun  directly in my eyes for instance.  Boo-fucking-hoo :) I am sure  this place is great when conditions are good though, so perhaps  worth another try on a morning. And yes, there is something cool  about paddling back in at sunset. </ul></blockquote>

The spot has the reputation of being  not very good and not very crowded, which is why I wanted to try  it on a weekend. And indeed, the wave is a bit sectiony, bumpy,  mushy (although today was perhaps not the best day obviously).  <li> I had forgotten to take board shorts! So I wore my shorts. Not the  most comfortable but it worked.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with a few nice shoulder-high drops that  were fun. But the rides themselves were nothing special. Still,  thinking about the mess that Waikiki probably was, it was a great  call to come here.  <li> Larry was surfing this pintail longboard he's thinking of buying  and that looked pretty decent (although he was surfing it  single-fin).  Tom was surfing his 9 footer, which I tried at the  end of the session.  That think is really high perf, with very  little volume, paper-thin tail, the fins are three identical  fins. Very much not a longboard but rather something made for  ripping on bigger waves. He had been complaining about this board  forever, and clearly it's not the right board for him at all.  It's also very dinged up, with unfixed dings letting the water to  the foam! So it's going to be hard to sell.  Oh well. </ul></blockquote>

Up to 7 people out.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, getting bigger and better as the tide  dropped with shoulder-high peaks at the end, super glassy, somewhat  consistent, very nice shape.  <li> Doug was on a paddle board! I tried it for 5 minutes and it was really, really hard. He can't really catch waves with it yet, but he's trying something new. He was totally happy with my longboard while I was using his paddle board though as he caught a very decent wave.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with 2-3 very nice ones toward the end although  not lined up all the way to the inside. It's so nice to surf such  glassy conditions, without a leash  <li> On the biggest wave of the day (head-high peak), I was the furthest out  but too far to the left of the peak. So I had to go left, which was  steep and closing out. I was pretty happy with my no-leash take  off with right hand grabbing the rail and holding, then turning towards the beach on the close out and holding on all the way. I think I would have probably lost my boards a few months ago.  <li> Toward the end I really caught two nice waves with a very nice wall.  <li> Most of the guys out seemed to be tourists and the vibe was "ok".  One of them seemed to have gotten scratched up on the coral. He  could hardly surf really, and I wonder how he managed to get hurt  with the tide that high. But he had a large patch of  scratched/bleeding skin on his back.  <li> That guy and that girl paddled out at the same time and I thought they  were together. Not looking happy though, but dropping in on each  other in the inside. Whatever. Waves were small, and I thought  they were together. In fact, Jim dropped in on me on a wave  earlier as I told him to go, etc. But later on, he's paddling for  a wave on the outside and the girl's inside. And as he's paddling  he said in a super pissed-off voice: "Can I have this wave?  PLEASE". That was a very odd vibe, especially because the wave  was knee-high at best. She didn't react at all and they both looked  so serious it was painful to watch.  <li> One turtle in the line up </ul></blockquote>

That's when I remember that today's exactly  10 days after the full moon, when the box jellyfish have the toxic  phase. But apparently it was sort of the end of the phase because  it wasn't too bad.

Really fun and once again adrenaline pumping and shaky limbs after the ride :)  <li> Caught a few lefts that closed out, but at some point I went for another 8ft right that ended up closing out completely. After making the drop and doing one bottom turn, there was no way I could escape off the back and instead I turned sharply to go straight to the best. After being caught up to by the white water I went under for quite a while and it sort of reminded me that perhaps I should be a little bit more careful and concerned when taking off on an 8ft wave over a coral reef.  <li> I was really tired at the end of the session and I caught a tiny wave on the inside back to the beach.  <li> It supposed to be bigger tomorrow.

The tide is sure coming up fast these days. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 5:45AM-7:35AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> Paddled out with Eric. Jim, Doug, Clarence, Greg, and Ron out.  <li> waist-high with a few chest-high waves coming through (head-high peaks). Glassy and organized. Pretty consistent. Not super powerful.  <li> Really fun conditions out there. Caught about 20 rides, with a bunch of fun ones. Didn't catch any of the bigger ones. Doug was on a super short board and still caught 2-3 very nice ones. Unbelievable.  <li> One one wave somebody dropped in on Doug and  fell, with board flying up, while Doug was in a super critical  portion of the wave. Doug being Doug he pulled off an amazing take  off, completely buried in white water and went around the guy, but  still, that was very lame. It's funny.  <li> Really a beautiful morning with dreamy rides. In the morning I felt  lazy and I almost didn't go out. I am glad I did. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 5:45AM-7:35AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> Paddled out with Jim and Eric. Some kid paddled out later, followed by Mitch and Clarence.  <li> knee- to waist-high, a bit windy, not very consistent. Overall  worse than yesterday but still a few fun rides to be had. Sort of  two peaks today, with the section breaking in front of the right  when taking off on the left-most peak on most waves.  <li> Caught about 20 waves. 2 Really fun take-offs right on the peak on  nicely shaped rights. Surprisingly fun actually. Other than that  nothing too special  <li> That kid, 13-14 years-old, who paddled out was sort of annoying.  Clearly still learning and asking tons of questions like: "How much  time in between sets?" I was like... "sets?" He couldn't turn and  would go straight on every wave, he would fall off 50% of the time,  and he would drop in. Not a good combination there. He was in my way  on one of the nicest waves and I had to pull out and he got completely  trashed by the white water. More notably, he dropped in  horribly on Mitch. Mitch yelled at him, but couldn't avoid the  collision because the kid went straight, and fell right away, 2  yards in front of Mitch. I was on the inside and heard the noise  of the two boards colliding. Almost no damage. I went in a few  minutes after that, but it was just odd. What was he doing out  there???  <li> The first gray morning in a long time. Today is supposed to be  the beginning of the rainy season. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, Pops, Paradise, 5:45AM-7:45AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself. Nobody at Threes or Paradise, 10 other people out at Pops.  <li> knee- to waist-high, glassy, not consistent with long lulls.  <li> First went to Threes. knee-high at best. Caught 3 waves though and then opted to paddle all the way to Pops.  <li> At Pops conditions were a big bigger, with a few sets with peaks higher than waist level. I caught about 10 rides there, including 3 on what I think were the three nicest waves of the morning. Somehow, I was always in position on the outside for these. Smooth take-offs, a few turns and then letting it go for the shortboarders on the inside if they can get in. I could tell a few of the longboarders out there were annoyed with my catching these nicer waves, but they were never even close to being in position for them. I was just a bit lucky I guess.  <li> After catching these waves and with the crowd becoming thicker I decided to paddle over to Paradise. I caught about 5 waves there, with fun drops and then almost no wall. Paddled in after that.  <li> Overall a beautiful morning with stunning sunrise over Diamond Head and a few waves. Not bad considering how lame conditions looked like initially. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 5:45AM-6:45AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself. Nobody out.  <li> knee- to waist-high, very windy, choppy, mixed up, horrible.  <li> Today I basically had to go out to get back on my normal sleep schedule after 1 week off from surfing. So I paddled out in the windiest conditions I've ever seen at Waikiki. It felt just like paddling out at Diamond Head. It was great being in the water though, and it was really warm out. I saw only one other person out at Pops, which wasn't surprising. One of the very worst Waikiki days ever I'd say.  <li> Did about 10 take-offs, with only 2-3 short rides. On the others I fell due to huge cross-wave bumps.  <li> Paddled back in after one hour. It was great to be in the water in spite of everything. Taking a shower on the beach was hard because the water from the spout was being blown off constantly. That's how windy it was.  The surf report said "light onshore". right. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 5:45AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself. Joined later by Eric and another  guy. Doug showed up on his paddle board.  <li> knee-high, sort of glassy, not consistent, weak.  <li> Much better than yesterday, but that's not saying much. Caught about  6 rides, with a nice surprising chest-high take off on a peak (which of  course reverted to knee-high almost immediately.  <li> Was really glad to see Eric paddle out so that I had somebody to talk to during the long lulls.  <li> Stunningly beautiful morning, if cloudy, with great sunrise on Diamond Head.  <li> At 7:30 a military helicopter got right above us, hovered for a  while and then used a speaker phone to say "all surfers back to  shore" and the guy pointed to the beach. It turns out there was an  earthquake in Japan yesterday and there was a Tsunami warning. Now,  the warning had been canceled, but there was a danger of "weird  current" and I guess they were taking precaution. That didn't make  much sense because the beaches were open and so surfers showing up  right after the helicopter departed would have no idea. But at this  point, given the conditions, we paddled in. Pretty odd. People on  the beach thought this was all shark-related. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 5:45AM-7:15AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> Paddled out with Jim. Joined later by Eric, Doug, and the other guy from yesterday. Some older guy that I've seen before came out at the end.  <li> knee- to waist-high with a few chest-high waves, super glassy, sort of consistent but soft and weak.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with a few fun ones, more rights than  lefts as usual. The swell was at an odd angle, not breaking in the  usual place and with a few funky waves. Beautiful morning out  there, great conversations in the water (although we talked about  euthanasia for about 20 minutes.... you know... typical tropical  paradise topic).  <li> 1 sea turtle on the outside  <li> Had to get out of the water a bit earlier to meet somebody in Waikiki for breakfast. The swell's supposed to build more tomorrow. We'll see.  9AM for work. </ul></blockquote>

I had one decent inside wave though, but otherwise rides were not the usual quality of Threes. I hate to whine about a day when I caught many, many waves though.  <li> Stunning sunrise on Diamond Head again today though. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> All over Waikiki, 5:45AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 9'2'', no leash  <li> By myself. about 10 people out total, including Eric.  <li> Super glassy, almost completely flat.  <li> I paddled out to Threes, which wasn't breaking, then to Paradise, then to Pops. Still no waves. I made it all the way to the inside of Canoes. Four guys were out and I caught 2 ankle-high waves that died out almost instantly. I paddled back out to Pops and Paradise where I met Eric. There we sat for a while and a waist-high wave came, which somehow I caught and rode. Probably the best wave of the morning actually.  <li> Beautiful morning, great conversation with Eric. </ul></blockquote>

One one of the big sets I was on the outside and  seemingly in position, but couldn't get in. Pretty sad. The  board ended up going over the falls while I had to fall back. Oh well.  <li> Really happy about many of my take-offs today, on the peak,  hugging the wall with hand in the water, pumping slightly to keep a  high line. Somehow I feel like today my surfing has improved. Not  often the case, so I am enjoying it for what it's worth. </ul></blockquote>
