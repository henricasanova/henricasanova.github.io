 <li> Toes, 2:30PM-4PM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez, no leash.  <li> By myself, alone for 30 minutes and then 3 other people out  <li> Knee- to wait-high, choppy-ish,  not  very  consistent, but still some waves coming through even though it was  flat  everywhere on the South shore  <li> Caught 10+ waves, with several nice lefts, suprisingly. Managed to cross-step a few times. </ul></blockquote>
