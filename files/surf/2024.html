 <li> Flies, 9AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, nobody out but a foil stand-up on the inside, and 2 loagboarders out who went back in after 10 minutes  <li> Waist- to occ. chest-high, consistent-ish but a bit mixed up, light to moderate winds.  <li> Caught 5 waves, with a couple of decent rights that brought me to the stairs.  <li> First session after being sick again for 2 weeks. Pretty out of shape/tired. </ul></blockquote>

Che got stuck on the inside for a looong time. Waves strated breaking pretty far outside. At some point I failed  to punch through a big one and went over the falls, at which point I called it quit as I was already pretty tired.  <li> Waist- to occ. chest-high, consistent-ish but a bit mixed up, light to moderate winds.  <li> Caught 5 waves, with a couple of decent rights that brought me to the stairs. </ul></blockquote>

I finally caught a mid-size one that turned out to be absolutely great with many turns on a wall that never really closed out and brought me almost to the stairs.  <li> Still felt pretty tired about being sick and not surfing much, but getting there </ul></blockquote>

Found it very difficult to drop down the face and I faled to cach many, many waves. Eventually caught a few (on the first one I basically had to jump on the nose to make it down the face).  <li> Will have to try it on another day when it's a bit better </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, up to 3-4 other people out at most, but basically always alone or at least alone near my peak  <li> Waist- to chest-high, consistent-ish, light winds, getting slower as tide went up  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with two super nice rights right at the beginning, and another one toward the end of the session. Overall a very nice session.  <li> Three police jetskis going through the inside and going toward Kewalo... </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'2'' Morgan  <li> By myself, Nodari showing up later, Amy out there, between 10 and 15 other people out  <li> waist- to head-high, consistent-ish but weirdly slow and misshapened, most bigger waves closing out, most smaller ones impossible to catch, glassy  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, none of them good. After catching these waves, coming back to the line-up was a workout, caught many on the head. Overall, not a very fun session at all, but a great workout for sure. I guess I am finally in decent shape after what feels like 1.5 months of sinus issues.  <li> Saw Eric in the parking lot as I was about to leave, and we chatted for 15 minutes or so. </ul></blockquote>

Really tired and weak, but still able to paddle and catch a few waves. So great being back in the water. </ul></blockquote>

Almost made it into one, but arms were like wet noodles  <li> Toward the end of the sesssion a massive set came by, and Tyler's leash broke! I was riding the white water inside anyway, and I fetched his board for him, end of session.  <li> The main point was to get a workout.... and that it was. </ul></blockquote>

My first and last waves were by far the best.  <li> Talked to that guy I know but whose name I can never remembers, who's about to got to mexico for a surftrip, and to another guy who told us about his arrowing accident at pipe that kept him 1 year out of any physical activity (hip pile-driven into the reef)  <li> I caught a wave in but then saw Tracy paddling out, so I went out for a couple of waves, waiting for Eric to get to the line-up. Chatted for a while, caught a couple waves and called it a day  <li> Caught no waves really due to the conditions and being so out of shape, but getting there. </ul></blockquote>

Consistent, light winds  <li> Caught 7 waves, all of them pretty nice and open all the way in but for one. And my last wave was absolutely amazing interms of shape, openness and size, with the head-high peak and then such a nice wall all the way in, with everybody paddling out to get over it.  <li> While walking to the spot I realized my board was water logged, which I knew would be coming, and which explained the weird dampness of the sock over the last few weeks. It was really heavy, and paddled out for a last session on it. And it was a good one! </ul></blockquote>
