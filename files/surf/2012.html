 <li> Tongs, 2:30PM-3:30PM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> With Rich. About 15 people out in total, which was way too many  considering the number of rideable waves.  <li> knee-high+, not very consistent, light winds.  <li> Caught 3-4 waves, nothing too exciting. Great to be back in the water  after such a long hiatus though. Absolutely out of paddling shape,  unsurprisingly. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Queens, 8:15PM-9:15PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry and Dave, nobody else out.  <li> knee-high+, super glassy, not very consistent but some waves coming  through.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of fun rights, considering.  <li> As usual, very pleasant, beautiful moon and calm weather. Found out  that Larry has a 5-year full moon surfing streak going! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Rich. About 15 people out, but quite spread out.  <li> waist-high, not super consistent but some waves, light winds  getting stronger as time went on.  <li> It had been ages since I surfed at Diamond Head, and this morning  was a pretty good choice. We stayed off the main peak and missed  the "best" waves, but still got a decent share.  <li> Caught about 12 waves, a couple of fun rights that were  reasonably long. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Old Man's, 10AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> With Bryson. Nobody out but canoes.  <li> Ankle-high, absolutely terrible, strong winds.  <li> Just paddled out to be in the water and stayed WAY inside  of the actual spot. Caught 2 non-waves.  <li> 1 turtle during the paddle back </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 5:30PM-6:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry. Around 5 people out.  <li> Moderate winds, not super consistent by head-high peaks coming  through once in a while (somewhat surprisingly).  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, including a great right with a steep but  holding section, and another right toward the end of the  session that was almost a close-out but ended up holding and  allowed for a few high lines before bottom-turning around small  closed out sections, all the way to the jetty.  <li> Quite an unexpected session really, with the nicest waves  I have surfed in months (unsurprisingly given the season and  my lack of water time). </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 11AM-12:20AM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash  <li> With Larry. Nobody out.  <li> Waist-high+, not super clean or consistent,  but decent, light winds.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of very nice ones (all rights).  <li> Pretty out of shape for paddling, and got "stuck" on the inside  a couple of time. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Martin and Armele.  <li> Waist-high+, somewhat consistent and clean, and getting gradually  less clean as the sessions progressed.  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with a couple of decent rights.  <li> It was Martin's and Armele first time ever on a surfboard.  Armele lost her sunglasses right away in the water. </ul></blockquote>

Up to 10 people out.  <li> Waist-high+, super inconsistent, but not too bad when the sets  would come.  <li> Caught about 10 rights, several of them pretty fun.

Up to 20 people out.  <li> Waist-high+, somewhat consistent, but way too many people  given the number of waves.  <li> Caught about 5 waves, all lefts, with a decent one. The other  ones were on the weak side.  <li> It was Mahdi's brother's first session, and of course he found  paddling absolutely exhausting. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Only Amy and I out for 1/2 hour, and then up to 5 people out.  <li> The first half hour was glassy, with up to head-high peaks. The bigger waves  closed out of course, but some of the shoulder-high were pretty nice. Right  after paddling to the line-up, got caught by an outside set, taking 4 waves on the  head, and taking forever to go back to the line-up. Not a great start of the session.  Then I caught 3-4 nice ones before others started paddling out, at which point  the conditions deteriorated massively into inconsistent, waist-high junk. Amy and  I attributed the good half hour to the famed "tide push". </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:00AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Mike, Phil, and Thomas (1st session). Only one other guy out.  <li> Waist- to shoulder-high, glassy, consistent until 9AM, then junky and windier as the tide  came up.  <li> Caught tons of fun waves today, probably more than 20. Several super fun rights, if not  very big. It had been a long time since I had seen it that glassy. Absolutely fun. I cannot  believe nobody was out.  <li> Thomas spent a lot of time paddling, as expected. Mike did a bit better as he had surfed  a few times before.  <li> Saw Eric in the parking lot! I hadn't seen him in ages. </ul></blockquote>

Sort of a letdown  after the previous sessions. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2012_Jun_4">Mon 4 Jun 2012</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8:15AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Up to 6 people out, including Eric and Jim.  <li> Waist- to chest-high waves, with a few head-high peaks, nice and  consistent at first and degrading as the wind picked up.  <li> Caught about 8 waves, with a few fun ones, but in particular  and absolutely outstanding right. I took off a bit deep and thought  that as usual the second steep section would close out in front of me.  Surprisingly, it stayed barely open and taking a super high line I was  able to make it through although it was getting quite vertical. Some  guy on the 3rd section was ready to drop in because of the typical  close-out, but pulled back as I zipped through that 3rd section again  on a very high-line, eventually cutting back a bit to weave my way to  the inside. Definitely the best wave I have surfed in at least a year.  The one after was even better, and that guy whom I've seen before a  few times had a fantastic ride. While my cutback were rather  smooth and non-radical, his were quite brutal on his 9ft board. Only  two waves on that set, and definitely the waves of the day. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Up to 8 people out, including Carl, Rohan, and Lorenzo on a short board.  <li> Waist- to occasional chest-high waves, not as good and consistent as  yesterday by a long shot.  <li> Caught about 15 waves and overall got a huge workout. A couple of the  smaller rights were fun and clean, but the bigger ones, unlike  yesterday, weren't that great. A few nice ones came through but I  wasn't in position.  <li> Great vibe/conversation in the water. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Up to 6-7 other people out including Jim and Patrick.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, choppy, messy, windy, but, somehow, still some  waves coming through.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, with one very nice one halfway through the session, with  the typical bottom turn around the close-out section and then connecting  to the inside. My best wave overall was my last one. Just when I saw 7 people  get in the water at the stairs and thought that it was time to go home, I was in  perfect position for that chest-high wave that held all the way to the jetty with  really fun if a bit bumpy sections. Really good way to end the session.  <li> At the end, Jim was on the inside by the jetty, trying to catch a small one that  would allow him to go around the tip of the jetty back to the stairs. </ul></blockquote>

Around 25 people out.  <li> Waist-high+, typical peaky/windy conditions  <li> Caught 3 waves, all rather short-lived even though the take-off was fun.  <li> Hadn't surfed Diamond Head in years, and this morning it seemed like a good option  given the tide and waves. I had almost forgotten what kind of surfing that was,  with shifting peaks and choppy conditions, yet rideable. </ul></blockquote>

Quite fun take-offs too as the wave was jacking up a little.  The swell had quite a bit of West in it, and the spot thus behaved quite differently from the typical  South Swell days.  <li> 1 sea turtle in the line-up </ul></blockquote>

Surprisingly  good really, especially given how windy/rainy it was all day.  <li> One of the rights was so nice that I rode it too far in  and found myself in super shallow water. </ul></blockquote>

The smaller ones today  were really hard to catch, so one had to wait for the bigger ones.  One head-high+ rogue wave came through though, but of course  everybody was too far in. </ul></blockquote>

Eric was paddling back to shore saying he was done wasting  his time out there and he's the one who suggested Sand Island.  Conditions weren't great there at all, but at least we got to go to a new spot.  It took some time to figure out where to park and paddle out.  <li> Caught about 5-6 waves, with one really fun and long left, and a couple  of fun take-offs. Looks like the spot's only a left though as my  attempts on the right were pretty infructuous.  Being at a new spot  always makes me feel out of sorts, and today the waves were  really tricky to catch anyway and very inconsistent. </ul></blockquote>

The spot wasn't working today, which I saw coming due to the high tide at 11AM, but I just had to get wet this week. </ul></blockquote>

Others  were not so great, but one left was ok I guess. Really odd conditions  out there. Caught a last insider at the end just to not have to  paddle in.  <li> I really thought that with the swell the noon high-tide wouldn't be  too much of a factor, but I was wrong and so were the people who  paddled out at 10AM! </ul></blockquote>

I had forgotten  have blinding the rising sun is when riding a right. I botched by  first 3 waves (not falling, but taking a wildly suboptimal line) just  because I couldn't see anything at all.  <li> It was nice being in the water with Eric after so many months  not surfing early morning. He's 3 months from retiring, and will  undoubtedly surf much more then!  <li> Pod of dolphins way on the outside. </ul></blockquote>

I though the swell was going  to be sufficient to negate the high tide, but that wasn't the case.  A few big sets came in and were not well-shaped, and few of  the smaller sets even broke.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, with two fun chest-high ones that had a fun  first section.
