A couple of nice lefts over crystal-clear water.  <li> A stupid boat zipped by the outside, creating tons of ripples, and  then, amazingly, went on the inside! I think they were trying to watch us  surf? It was so stupid (and illegal). </ul></blockquote>

On a tiny wave I went over a hole in the reef where I saw 5 big turquoise parrotfishes. Quite a stunning, cloud-less morning.  <li> Caught about 8-9 waves, all but one in the second half of the session. A couple of nice lefts over crystal-clear water. </ul></blockquote>
