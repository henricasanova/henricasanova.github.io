 <li> Toes, 9AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez, no leash  <li> By myself, 2 other people out.  <li> Knee-high, almost glassy, pretty weak and inconsistent, drizzling at times.  <li> Caught only 3-4 waves, all lefts. Just a good workout. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 9AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez, no leash  <li> By myself, 4 other people out  <li> Knee- to waist-high, glassy and light winds at the end, pretty weak and inconsistent for the first part of the session, but much better at the end.  <li> Caught about 8-9 waves, all but one in the second half of the session. A couple of nice lefts over crystal-clear water.  <li> A stupid boat zipped by the outside, creating tons of ripples, and  then, amazingly, went on the inside! I think they were trying to watch us  surf? It was so stupid (and illegal). </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 9AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez, no leash  <li> By myself, 2 to 4 other people out  <li> Knee- to occ. waist-high, glassy, inconsistent on the outside for sure, but nice little insiders.  <li> Caught 10+ waves, with a couple of nice lefts.  <li> Water was pretty dirty due to the lack of wind (mostly with branches, leaves, flowers though), but still clear. On a tiny wave I went over a hole in the reef where I saw 5 big turquoise parrotfishes. Quite a stunning, cloud-less morning.  <li> Caught about 8-9 waves, all but one in the second half of the session. A couple of nice lefts over crystal-clear water. </ul></blockquote>
