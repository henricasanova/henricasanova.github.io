 <li> Threes, 2PM-3:30PM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> By myself. One older guy out on and SUP.  <li> Waist-high, pretty clean and consistent, glassy.  <li> First session after coming back from freezing Europe where I spent  Christmas. Flies wasn't working, and after looking at Rockpiles  I figured I wouldn't go in. But as I was going around the Kaiser  parking lot a look at Threes convinced me to go. Turns out it was  a great "getting back into surfing" session.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with a couple of pretty fun rights that  were a little bit above waist-high.  <li> On my 1st wave, a huge multi-colored parrot fish swam under  my board. 1 Turtle in the line-up. Definitely good to be  back in Hawai`i. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Queens, 9PM-10:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry, Conrad, and a friend of his. Nobody else out.  <li> Waist-high+, pretty clean and sort of consistent, light  winds.  <li> First night session of the year. Caught about 10 waves, including  2 very fun long rights. I am really out of shape after spending  1 month doing nothing in Europe. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Queens, 9PM-10:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry and Dave. Nobody else out.  <li> Waist-high, supper glassy and pretty clean, sort of consistent.  <li> Nice conditions out, nicer than yesterday.  <li> Caught 10-12 rides, with a couple of fun long rights that were  super clean. My paddling is getting less pathetic, which is good.  <li> At some point during the session Larry saw a big splash in the water  on the outside. Sort of spooked us a little bit.  <li> We note that night visibility in the winter, with the moon  over the mountains is definitely not as good as when it's over the horizon. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2010_Feb._9">Tue 9 Feb. 2010</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6:45AM-8AM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> With Larry. Nobody else out.  <li> Waist-high, sort of bumpy, not consistent at all, but a few waves  in the middle of the session.  <li> Following Larry's hard-core optimistic "let's not check conditions  before we paddle out", it looked like this could be a no-wave  session. But, with help from the dropping tide, we actually had  a decent 1/2 hour in the middle of the session, with somewhat  consistent waves. The beginning and the end of the session were  pretty much dead though.  <li> Caught about 8 waves. Pretty fun take-offs and then short  rides. The waves were oddly challenging today, sort of  jacking up more than usual, so that was fun. Rides were  nothing special and the shoulder died quickly.  <li> Great to be in the water for a beginning of the year with so  little surfing due to various colds, hurt shoulder, and lack  of waves. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:45AM-8AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry. Justin paddled out, and later Carl. Met Eric in the  parking lot after the session.  <li> Waist-high+, glassy, much more consistent than yesterday, even though there was a lull toward the end of the session.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, including a pretty intense left with a  steep take-off, and a couple of decent rights.  <li> I had my first wipe-out of the year on a total close-out.  <li> Some jellyfish in the water, birds picking fish right out of  the waves, and a pod of dolphins way outside that we spotted  after the session.  <li> A pretty nice session overall, with super nice weather and conditions. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:45AM-8AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Larry. up to 8 people out including Justin, Conrad, Eric, Rob  <li> waist-high+, light wind and rain on and off, not consistent and  weakened by the tide that was dropping but was still too high.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, with two really nicely shaped and fun rights. I missed several waves because they were just too slow and I couldn't pull in. Justin got the one head-high wave of the day, with a great ride.  <li> Eric told this hilarious story about the way he "snaked" Jim at Threes.  After paddling to the line-up, he went up to Jim and told him that parking on the street was terrible. Jim said "yeah, I got the last spot!" to which  Eric replied "what? I didn't see your truck!" Since Jim had parked in an odd spot, Eric thought it hilarious to play a joke on him. Jim immediately caught a wave in and he said afterward that he was worried the whole time about his truck having been towed. Eric just knows how to empty the line-up!  <li> Very intense rainbows during most of the session, but I was pretty  much freezing the whole time. Definitely not ready for California in 2 weeks. </ul></blockquote>

Up to 12 people in the line-up, including Conrad.  <li> waist- to shoulder-high with a couple of bigger sets, glassy,  not super consistent but not bad.  <li> Decided for a later session today, waiting for the tide to be  a bit lower. Met Justin in the parking lot after his session.  <li> It was a bit too crowded, but not terrible. Caught 10+ waves,  with a couple of really nice holding lefts, and a few  smaller  rights. I didn't really feel like jockeying for position for the  bigger rights with 6+ shortboarders on the inside.  <li> On the bigger set of the day, which was slightly overhead,  I was right in the impact zone. It was actually nice to go  under a big wave for the first time in a while  <li> Overall a pretty good session. </ul></blockquote>

Most waves weren't breaking though. Toward the end of the session  a nice set would come every 15 minutes, with absolutely nothing  in between.  <li> I decided to stay out longer and catch a ride with Justin. We waited  until the sunset and I was lucky enough to catch one of the rare  waves in, to conclude an odd but enjoyable session. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8AM-9:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. Saw Eric as he was getting out, and Jay left right after  I got to the line-up. Alone with Brian for 1h, and then one other  person out.  <li> Waist-high+, glassy, clean, not very consistent.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with a couple of really nice rights with  nice little walls. Nothing super exciting, but the conditions were  just beautiful with bright sun and sheet glass water.  <li> Light to strong winds, waist-high+, very inconsistent with a 1/2-hour </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Canoes, 8:15PM-8:40PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Larry, Conrad, and Dave. Nobody else out.  <li> Waist-high+, glassy, sort of consistent, kind of pitching and poor  visibility.  <li> Conrad was telling this story about this morning at Flies were two  guys independently saw a big shark in the line-up, only hours  after I was there, and how everybody just paddled in.  <li> Right after getting to the line-up I had 2 wipe outs and 1  reasonable wave, when all of a sudden this  huge splash happened about 30 feet from us. Conrad saw a big  dorsal fin, and I saw little fish jumping out of the water.  Most likely a good size shark hunting!  We paddled back to  the beach right away, to conclude a super short session.  <li> Not sure how much night surfing I'll be doing in the near future. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sub, Sunset Cliffs, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On an 8'6''  <li> With Dario. 5-6 other people out.  <li> chest- to head-high, glassy, not very organized wind swell,  light wind, and surprisingly not too cold for me.  <li> Caught 4 waves, with a nice first one and then pretty lame others.  First session after 1 month of working/eating in Europe  without any physical activities and 10 hours after landing,  cold water, with a wetsuit, with different waves, and a  different board. Not a recipe for a super successful  session, but overall pretty pleasant.  <li> Beautiful weather, one seal in the line-up briefly.  <li> Sort of enjoyed the breakfast at People's more than the  session :) </ul></blockquote>

One other guy out.  <li> waist- to chest-high, weak and not very consistent wind swell,  offshore breeze.  <li> Super sore today from the session yesterday... aah... the  joys of getting back into surfing after one month of sitting  around.  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with a couple of ok ones but nothing to write  home about. Really weak in terms of paddling but at least I wasn't  as cold in the water as Travis and Dario.  <li> After my last wave I got caught in a current on the inside. 10 minutes  of admittedly very weak paddling got me nowhere and so I gave up  and went in. Overall a pretty pleasant session even though the waves  looked better than they actually were.  <li> In the parking lot, Dario was so tired and his hands were so  cold and numb that he couldn't even remove his booties and I  had to remove them for him! Insanity. Travis and I laughed our  asses off. Nothing like the 1/2 hour parking lot hang out at the  cliffs after the session. </ul></blockquote>

Very short and weak rides,  but for one right that was halfway decent.  <li> One nice chest-high set came through. I tried to drop in but  was a bit too inside. Ended up riding it down on my stomach and  bailing at the first opportunity. Really a shame since that was  clearly the wave of the day but a huge margin  <li> Nice to be back in balmy waters after the last two sessions. </ul></blockquote>

Justin showed up a bit later.  <li> Waist-high to chest-high, very inconsistent, light winds but  pretty smooth.  <li> There were a few decent sets coming through but somehow I missed  them. It seems that I would always paddle for a small one, not  catch it, and turn around to see each of the few bigger sets on  the outside. In the end caught only two waves, a tiny right, and  my last wave which was pretty nice and brought Justin and I all the  way to the stairs.  <li> Nice to be sort of in surfing shape, although this cold I caught in  California seems to not ever go away. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2010_Apr._16">Fri 16 Apr. 2010</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6AM-8AM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> With Eric on his SUP. Nobody else out.  <li> knee- to waist-high, pretty weak an inconsistent at times, but  still waves coming through.  <li> When I pulled up to the parking lot, I thought I saw that Eric  had taken his board out of the car. So I geared up super fast to  go up the hill, expecting good conditions. That's where I found him, and he announced to me that there  were no waves. Darn his SUP that was hiding his longboard  in his car!  He was going to take out his SUP and I decided to  paddle out just for kicks after I saw at least one wave break.  <li> It turned out to be a much better session than I thought. I caught  perhaps 15 rideable waves in spite of the grim outlook and it  was quite a workout, especially because Eric and I traded boards twice.  As a result, I got quite a bit of time on his SUP. Pretty big workout, as expected, and a very different workout. After a short adaptation period I was  paddling it OK. I even managed to get into a wave paddling and  to ride for 10-15 yards! But that took a lot of effort and by the  end of the session, after catching another 4-5 waves on my longboard,  I was pretty tired.  <li> About 20 minutes after we got to the line-up we saw Justin on the  shore waving at us and shouting something. At that time I was  on Eric's SUP and I thought Justin was just taunting me for going  over to the dark side. He was making weird signs I didn't  get at all, so after a while I paddled over. Turns out, he  had seen a shark in the water just 15 minutes prior, right  by the jetty, swimming toward Ala Moana. Not a very big one  from what he said. At that point, I debated what to do.  But in the end I figured that we know there are sharks, and  that the odds of being attacked in broad daylight on a  longboards are really low. Besides, in 15 minutes, the Shark  could have been easily miles away, and more likely that not  there was at least another shark closer that we simply  wouldn't even see. So I paddled back out after Justin  announced his decision to go back home. It was true enough  that the condition were not very compelling, and had I seen  the shark with my own eyes I may have done the same. I  paddled back out to Eric and he completely didn't care. He's  seen quite a few sharks over the years, and a shark seen 15  minutes ago, swimming away, 200 yards from the line-up, is  just not something he was going to worry about.  I concurred  and we ended up having a really pleasant, if tiring,  session. </ul></blockquote>

A bit choppy  with light winds, and not very consistent.  <li> Because the swell was South-West, the waves were breaking  pretty oddly today, with several lefts and many close outs.  Still, pretty nice to be in uncrowded waters with some  energy in the ocean. Caught about 6-7 waves, but only 1  with a clean open face. Several fun take-offs though, with short  and steep sections. On one of them I should really have pulled in  (and subsequently eat it), but I just played it safe each time. </ul></blockquote>

That was right when  that freak set cam through. He opted to go to shore. I paddled out  for one more wave and then called it a day.  <li> It rained a couple of times during the session.  <li> Found a floating dead fish in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

Impossible to tell what the waves  were doing by looking at the horizon. This reminded me of a  couple of Rainbow sessions: just pick a spot, don't even  look at what's coming unless it's 2 seconds out.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of pseudo-decent ones  that, unexpectedly, stayed open all the way to the inside.  <li> Due to the winds, there was tons of bits of plastic floating  in the water. Picked up as much as I could, but it just gives  an idea of all that's floating out there... </ul></blockquote>

By the  time Patrick paddled out I was completely exhausted after my  first longish session since coming back. I even had a hard time  catching a last wave.

Bailed on a  wave on which I was in the perfect spot, wiped out on late  take-offs, missing waves left and right. I guess that's what  10 days off and sick will do to you.

Super glassy  at first and then light winds.  <li> Today the conditions felt like the tide was high although it was  getting close to low. So waves were fat and slow, and hard to get into, especially for the few shortboarders out there (including Conrad). However, waves were really, really clean and beautiful.  <li> Caught 15+ waves, with 3 or 4 very nice long rights with a very  open face all the way in.  <li> At some point I felt a bump on my fin, and I saw this fish (looked  like a large whitespotted toby) going round my board, and bumping  on it repeatedly with its nose, then back to the fin. Really odd. Not  sure what was going on.  Talked about it with that large hawaiian  guy who was struggling on his first day on his new 8ft board although  he had never ridden anything under 11ft. He had never seen this before  but its main comment was that it was all good as long as I wasn't  being bumped by a shark :)  <li> There was this guy out who wasted so many nice waves on his longboard  before Conrad and I figured out he just couldn't go right at  all (goofy-footed). I don't think I've ever seen somebody who just  could only go one way to this extent.  <li> Overall a very pleasant session. </ul></blockquote>

We swapped boards  several time and I caught about 5-6 waves on my 9'6''.  <li> The irony is that the only nice wave of the day came right  after Larry, Dario, and I swapped board. I managed to drop in  on that wave for a nice take off, but on my 9'6'' instead of my  6'8''.  <li> The fin setup for the 6'8'' was completely off (surfed it as a  thruster), which, according to Dario, made the board squirly. Next  session will be with the default 5-ft setup.  <li> Somehow, for no clear reason, we stayed out 2 1/2 hour in the water!  Absolutely ridiculous given the conditions, but over pleasant if  completely exhausting.

My first take-off was absolutely terrible and I fell off.  Going to such a shorter board sort of feels like learning how  to surf again. But then, perhaps surprisingly, I was able to  get to my feet quite consistently. Now, those take-offs weren't  good enough to allow me to get a good start on the wall or anything,  but I feel that that may happen at some point, which is good. In  particular there was one nice wave where I was in the perfect  spot, but had to readjust my feet after the take-off, and thus  missed the section.

Turns out that  even though it's a bit easier, it's really not that different  from the 6'8'' since it's much less buoyant. I fell on my first  take-off, the same way I fell on my first take-off yesterday. But  after that, I made all take-offs, probably a bit better than  yesterday on the 6'8''. Handling the crowds was a bit of a pain  and I ended up caught inside quite a few times when big outside  sets came. There were a couple of overhead such sets.  <li> I was getting pretty tired after a lot of paddling, when  that beautiful shoulder-high wave came. I was in position and  dropped in. I had a fantastic ride, zipping through sections  all the way to the jetty. Deciding to end on a high note, I called  it quit at that point.

 <li> Flies, 8:45AM-11AM  <li> On my 6'8''.  <li> By myself. Alone for a while, then 2 guys out, then Rick.  <li> Waist-high+, getting better as it got glassier as as the tide went out.  <li> It was pretty terrible when I paddled out, but I just had to get wet  after not surfing for a week or so. Paddling on that board is really  not too bad, and today my goal was to try to take off on as many waves  as possible. I had perhaps 12 take-off totals due to super  long lulls. I made about half of them, albeit not  gracefully/smoothly at all. The sad thing is that those were  all on crappy waves. 4 times I was in the perfect spot on a  wave that peaked at chest-high and was glassy, and 4 times I  botched the take off, mostly falling backward, and once  getting to my feet but so slowly that at that point I was  going straight. Basically, I am facing the typical  longboard-to-shortboard deal, when taking off in the  steepest part is to technically difficult and taking off in  the not-steepest part is impossible. Rick and I talked about  it a lot and he was full of good advice. At least I go water  time on the board and I guess it can go nowhere but up at  this point. The good thing is that I didn't feel too tired  and feel like I can paddle forever on that thing. Just feel  like learning how to surf again. </ul></blockquote>

That one was juicy, and stayed steep  all the way to the stairs with makeable section after  makeable section.  <li> Overall not a bad session at all considering that I have been out  of the water for 2 months!
