 <li> Flies, 12:00PM-1:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Larry. Nobody out.  <li> Knee- to occ. chest-high, not consistent at all (North Shore wrap  from the huge swell up there), moderate winds, beautiful weather.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, without catching any of the bigger ones.  <li> Not in too horrible a shape even though the last session was  more than one month ago. Objective for the year: surf more than  12 times :) </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Mar_3">Mon 3 Mar 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> In-Betweens, 6:30AM-8AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Nodari. About 15 people out.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, reasonably consistent, very light winds, cloudy.  <li> Caught about 4 waves, all lefts.  <li> Incredibly out of shape after so long out of the water due to  lack of waves, bad weather, or too much work. But great to be  back in the water  <li> Nodari's first session in Hawaii. He cut up his foot a bit on  the reef as it's pretty shallow on the inside. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> In-Betweens, 6:45AM-8:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Olivia. About 15 people out.  <li> Waist-high, smooth, reasonably consistent, no wind, a bit cloudy.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of decent ones.  <li> Already in much better shape than 2 days ago.  <li> Olivia's first session in 2 years, and she caught a couple of waves! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Mar_11">Tue 11 Mar 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Queens, 8:30PM-10PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Larry, Dave, Conrad, Ann. 3 other people out.  <li> Waist-high, with occasional bigger sets, smooth, reasonably consistent, no wind, clear skies with 3/4 moon  <li> Caught something like 20 waves, with a few fun rights. Overall a beautiful night session.  <li> There was a weird point on the inside that broke really well, not sure why. Dave identified it, and then we caught a lot of inside waves that way. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Mar_14">Fri 14 Mar 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Cliffs (Diamond Head), 7:00PM-8:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Nodari and Raoul, about 10 other people out  <li> Waist-high+, light winds, reasonably consistent but not very nicely shaped, typical.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, some of them ok, nothing to write home about.  <li> Beautiful morning out there </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Mar_21">Fri 21 Mar 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Rock Pile, 7:00PM-8:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Nodari, about 6-7 people out.  <li> Waist-high, moderate winds, not very consistent, beautiful weather.  <li> Caught about 5 waves, with one decent right.  <li> Given the forecast, the surf was much smaller than  expected. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Apr_6">Sun 6 Apr 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 7AM-9AM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash  <li> With Nodari, the usual 8-guy crew, and then only a couple of people  out for the second half of the session  <li> Waist-high to occ. chest-high, not very consistent and a bit weak,  glassy for the most part.  <li> A lot of work to catch waves today, especially early on in the session. The conditions felt very high-tidish, but the tide was negative. Conditions improved substantially after the morning crew went in though.  <li> Caught about 15 weaves, with a couple of fun rights and one great  one that was in the chest-high range.  <li> I talked Nodari into removing his leash for a bit, and of course  that's right when the biggest/cleanest set of the day came in, with  head-high peaks. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Apr_29">Tue 29 Apr 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Tongs, 5:30PM-7PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Mahdi, about 10 other people out.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, not consistent at all,  and a bit killed by the high tide.  <li> Caught about 6-7 waves, all lefts, with a couple of decent ones.  But it was a bit of a struggle to catch waves. We're almost in May  already and we still have to see a decent South swell...  <li> Beautiful evening, with great view of sunset-lit Diamond Head, etc. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_May_3">Sat 3 May 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 10:45AM-12PM  <li> On my 9'6'', no leash  <li> By myself, Carl out at first, and at the end 3-4 people including Jim  <li> Waist-high+, not very consistent but not bad, shape getting worse  as the wind increased, but size getting a bit bigger as well.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of fun rights. Really nice  to be essentially alone in the line-up for close to 1 hour.  <li> Lost my board on a late take-off and had to swim really far in to  get it. Nice workout.  <li> Dive O'ahu was doing dive certifications at Flies this morning  (said hi to Lindsey). A bit crazy given the swell, but doable  I guess. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_May_16">Fri 16 May 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 7AM-8:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. Up to 10 other people out at some point.  <li> Waist- to occ. head-high, glassy, very inconsistent.  <li> Caught 6 waves, with a couple of fun rights. The bigger ones  were closing out most of the time. It was nice to  be in the water with some wave energy after months with so little  surf.  <li> The session ended with a 20-min lull with absolutely nothing. Ended  up riding a close-out back to shore. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_May_20">Tue 20 May 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6:30AM-8AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. Only 1 other guy out for a long time, then up to 4,  and down to 1. We actually talked about the fact that it was  surprising to not have a crowd with decent waves.  <li> Waist- to occ. shoulder-high, glassy, very consistent for the  1st half of the session, less toward the end.  <li> Caught about 12 waves, with 2 very good rights that remained  open for the first section with a beautiful wall, and then with  enough power to allow me to go around the middle section.  <li> Quite an enjoyable session overall, getting slowly back into  surfing shape. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_May_22">Thu 22 May 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6:30AM-8AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Nodari. Up to 8 people out, but only the two of us at the end.  Carl was out there. Amy on a SUP (hadn't seen her in ages).  <li> Waist- to chest-high, not very consistent, a bit weak, glassy at  first but then quite a bit of texture in the water due to the wind.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 2 good rights. Several bigger sets came,  but mostly closing out.  <li> Overall a great workout and a decent session. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_May_23">Fri 23 May 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>

Up to 4 other people out.  <li> Waist- to occ. chest-high, glassy, not super consistent but not bad.  <li> Caught 10+ waves, with 3 pretty fun rights. The swell was cleaner  than yesterday, but with less power. Pretty nice session overall. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Three, 7:15AM-8:45AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Nodari. Up to 6 other people out.  <li> Waist-high+, not consistent at all and weak (seemed like it  was a high-frequency wind swell).  <li> Caught about 8-9 waves, with 2 surprisingly fun rights. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:15AM-9:45AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Nodari. Up to 5 other people out, including  Jim and Eric.  <li> Waist-high+, not consistent at all with long lulls, and oddly shaped,  but a beautiful day out there in terms of weather.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with 2 surprisingly fun rights. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Jun_9">Mon 9 Jun 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 7AM-10:30AM  <li> On my new 9'2'' Morgan  <li> With Nodari, who went in early. Up to 15 people out, including Eric  <li> Chest-high, inconsistent but some nice waves coming through. Wind picked up as the session went on.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 3 or 4 fun rights, and one outstanding  right that remained open all the way.  <li> It had been a long time since I clocked in at more than 3 hours for  a session. I guess I am getting back into paddling shape, just in  time before taking two months off! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 7AM-10:30AM  <li> On my new 9'2'' Morgan  <li> With Larry. 3-4 other people out.  <li> waist-high, inconsistent and bumpy, windy.  <li> Caught only 2 waves, really a poor session but as usual happy  to be out there. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> In-betweens, 3:30PM-5PM  <li> On my new 9'2'' Morgan  <li> With Melody (on my 9'6'') and Christopher (on my 9'2'' Stewart), about 10 other people out.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, not consistent, very weak, light winds.  <li> Caught about 20 waves, but catching waves required a lot of paddling  and M and C couldn't catch a single thing. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 5:45PM-7PM  <li> On Dario's 9'  <li> With Dario. Nobody out.  <li> Knee-high, not breaking due to the high tide, but beautiful  late afternoon out there  <li> Caught one wave, which was a miracle given that there was almost  nothing breaking! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Jun_24">Tue 24 Jun 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 12:30PM-2:30PM  <li> On Dario's 9'  <li> With Dario. Between 2 and 5 other people out.  <li> Waist-high, glassy, somewhat consistent.  <li> Caught about 20 waves, fund take-offs, and then somewhat weak  walls (the left was better actually, but somehow I caught mostly  rights).  <li> What a beautiful day out, very mellow vibe, full sun and almost  no wind. Sort of burnt my feet on the walk to the spot! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2014_Jun_25">Wed 25 Jun 2014</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Subs, 1:30PM-4PM  <li> On Dario's 9'  <li> With Dario. Between 2 and 5 other people out.  <li> Waist-high+, glassy, consistent.  <li> Caught about 30 waves, including one fantastic right with a  steep take-off, a great first section on a high-line and then  a super fast inside section. Right after that wave I caught  another one that was a bit smaller but with a completely lined-up  fast wall on the inside.  <li> What a great and somewhat unexpected session out there (Summer at  the Cliffs with good waves and almost nobody out???).  Really had to  be on the peak to catch waves, but they were coming pretty  regularly with sort of shifting peaks.  <li> After one of my rides, a kid on the inside on a long board, with  a pound of sunblock on his face, asked me "hey! Do you have a  sticker?", to which I answered "what? no!" and he went "Dang  it!". wtf??? Paddled back, and 10 minutes later Dario came back  after his last wave and said "Hey! That kid on the inside asked  me for a sticker and went 'dang it!' when I told him I didn't  have one!". Really, really odd. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 2PM-4PM  <li> On my 9'2'' Morgan  <li> With Larry. Nobody out but for a shortboarder at the end.  <li> Really weak at the beginning and then up to 4-5ft as the  tide dropped, somewhat inconsistent, moderate winds.  <li> Caught about 8 waves, with one really good right, and the others  somewhat marginal.  <li> Great session to get back into things. Less out of shape that  I would've thought. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 2PM-4PM  <li> On my 9'2'' Morgan  <li> By myself.  10 other people out including Jay and Conrad. Saw Eric and his  daughter after I got out of the water. They were off to go surf Wainae.  <li> Shoulder to head-high, not very consistent, oddly shaped, difficult to catch, light winds.  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with one pretty nice right. Others tended to close out.  <li> Very odd session. First, I went out with my wallet in the pocket of  my board shorts! No biggy, but still sort of annoying. Good thing  I didn't lose it. Also, my laundry detergent had dripped onto my  hat and wetsuit, somehow. I sort of noticed the rashguard had an  odd feel to it, but once in the water it starting bubbling and I  got slick all over. On my first take-off my hands were like bars  of soap and and totally botched it.  After rubbing most of the  detergent out, it got better, and I guess I don't feel too bad about  that reef given that the harbor nearby must do its share of  polluting. Definitely need to find my groove again :) </ul></blockquote>

Bigger sets came through  with a fair share of close-outs, but as usual occasional open  nice waves.  <li> Caught about 6 waves, with one very nice right. Ate it on a couple  steep ones, including a left on which I tried to grab the rail and  hand on but was sucked over the falls.  <li> One turtle in the impact zone!  <li> Saw Jordan at the stairs. Hadn't seen him in a long time and he  was there just checking out the waves without his board. </ul></blockquote>

A couple of bigger waves came through. I was able to take of on one of those, and the take off was fun even though it ended up closing out. I barely made it over the 2nd big wave while everybody else got wiped out.  <li> All in all a pretty fun session. The swell's supposed to build tomorrow. We'll see. </ul></blockquote>

But there were sufficient lulls. </ul></blockquote>

With the rising tide it initially looked like it wasn't going to  work out. A lot of wobbliness in the water, some backwash, etc. But then,  bigger sets came and surprisingly fun rides were to be had. </ul></blockquote>

One one wave I had  to straighten out due to people paddling on the inside and found  myself in the shallows. Slightly dinged the board, which was  annoying. </ul></blockquote>
