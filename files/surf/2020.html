 <li> Old Man, 10AM-11:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez, no leash  <li> By myself, up to 3 other people out, alone for at least 30min  <li> Kneed- to waist-high, inconsistent and weak.  <li> Caught 3 waves, all lefts of  course, nothing to report  <li> It was nice getting in the water after 1.5 month in France for family reasons, and then 2 weeks sick with some flu-like bug  (but not  the coronavirus... Ha!) in Hawaii. Sooooo out of shape though. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Old Man, 3PM-4PM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez, no leash  <li> By myself, up to 3-4 people out  <li> Knee- to waist-high, consistent-ish,  light winds  <li> Caught 4 waves  <li> First session in a long time due to being  sick, and then due to  the Coronavirus lockdown. Pretty out of shape of course, but  things should be getting better if I get wet next week. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Old Man, 4PM-5:30PM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, up to 7-8 people out  <li> Knee- to waist-high, pretty weak,  light winds  <li> Caught 3 waves, all pretty weak  <li> Not as out of shape as last week! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_May_14">Thu 14 May 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 3PM-4:30PM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, up to 10 people out  <li> waist- to chest-high, clean and nice for the  first 45 minutes, and then there was  a 45-min lull with absolutely no waves. Light winds.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, with a couple very nice open rights.  <li> Today most waves stayed nicely open all the way in... </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_May_15">Fri 15 May 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6:30PM-8:30PM  <li> On my 9'2'' Morgan  <li> By myself, up to 10 people out including Nodari and Phil  <li> waist- to chest-high, clean but not consistent at all, no wind  <li> Caught 3-4 waves, short sections. A few bigger ones came through  but they were really hard to get into and almost always  closing out. So different from yesterday... </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_May_18">Mon 18 May 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 2:30PM-4PM  <li> On my 9'2'' Morgan  <li> By myself, up to 3-4 people out, including Tracy and Eric on the shore  <li> chest- to head-high+, long waits between sets, but sets  came really regularly, light winds  <li> All bigger waves closed out. FIrst surfed the inside, and then went  to the line-up  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with nothing great due to mushy inside or  closing out outside </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_May_20">Wed 20 May 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8AM-9AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, alone for a while, one other guy out  <li> waist-high+, clean and consistent, no winds.  <li> Caught 2 nice rights. At the end of the 2nd one I sat back  down on my board, and as I laid bacck down on it I tweaked  my back. I did paddle back out and caught one more wave in  and called it a day. Hopefully it won't be too bad, but it's  clearly not "nothing". Too bad since conditions were nice and  there was no one out. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_May_27">Wed 27 May 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, 2-3 other longboarders out (including Ben and Gina), and  3-4 foilers on the inside.  Turtle in the line-up.  <li> waist-high, very inconsistent, sort of clean earlier but very ugly at the end.  <li> Was able to get back into surfing after two trips to the chiropractor. Not 100%, but pretty close.  <li> Caught 3 pretty nice rights early on, and then the conditions deteriorated. Ended up catching 2 more horrible waves in the next hour, and decided to go in on the 2nd one. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_May_29">Fri 29 May 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 7:30AM-9AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, 6-7 other people out, shortboard foilers, SUP foilers,  standard SUPs, shortboarders, longboarders. The works.  Turtle in the line-up.  <li> Waist- to occ. chest-high, consistent-ish, pretty clean but deteriorating toward the end a bit.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with 3-4 really good rights. Not completely open but not closing either, possible to go around sections.  <li> Really good session overall. No back problems, which was great. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_Jun_1">Mon 1 Jun 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, up 6-7 other people out, including Garry.  <li> Waist-high+, clean a bit weak, somewhat consistent, no wind  <li> Caught about 12 waves, with a couple of  fun rights. Others  didn't have much of a wall to work with and sort of petered out. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_Jun_2">Tue 2 Jun 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, up 10 other people out, including Nodari and Phil. Saw Eric, Tracey, and Jim in the lot after the session.  <li> Waist- to head-high, very weird shape/angle, somewhat consistent  but for a 20 minute lull. Getting bigger but weirder as the  tide rose.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with only 2 pretty fun rights. The others  where closing out, and a few bigger outside sets we took on the head.  <li> Saw a small shark swimming along a wave that was standing up, one turtle on the outside. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2020_Jun_5">Fri 5 Jun 2020</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'2'' Morgan  <li> By myself, up 8 other people out, including Jim, Jacky, Ben. Say Eric and Tracey in the lot after the session.  <li> Waist- to shoulder-high, consistent-ish, glassy at first and then windy at the end, pretty fun size.  <li> Caught about 20 waves, with 2-3 really nice rights that stayed open all the way to the channel. Somehow did a number of pretty poor take-offs today, especially as conditions evolved with the rising tide and rising wind.  <li> Finally feeling  like I am in decent paddling shape! </ul></blockquote>
