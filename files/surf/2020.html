 <li> Old Man, 10AM-11:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez, no leash  <li> By myself, up to 3 other people out, alone for at least 30min  <li> Kneed- to waist-high, inconsistent and weak.  <li> Caught 3 waves, all lefts of  course, nothing to report  <li> It was nice getting in the water after 1.5 month in France for family reasons, and then 2 weeks sick with some flu-like bug  (but not  the coronavirus... Ha!) in Hawaii. Sooooo out of shape though. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Old Man, 3PM-4PM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez, no leash  <li> By myself, up to 3-4 people out  <li> Knee- to waist-high, consistent-ish,  light winds  <li> Caught 4 waves  <li> First session in a long time due to being  sick, and then due to  the Coronavirus lockdown. Pretty out of shape of course, but  things should be getting better if I get wet next week. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 3PM-4:30PM  <li> On my 9'6'' Hernandez  <li> By myself, up to 10 people out  <li> waist- to chest-high, clean and nice for the  first 45 minutes, and then there was  a 45-min lull with absolutely no waves. Light winds.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, with a couple very nice open rights.  <li> Today most waves stayed nicely open all the way in... </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:30PM-8:30PM  <li> On my 9'2'' Morgan  <li> By myself, up to 10 people out including Nodari and Phil  <li> waist- to chest-high, clean but not consistent at all, no wind  <li> Caught 3-4 waves, short sections. A few bigger ones came through  but they were really hard to get into and almost always  closing out. So different from yesterday... </ul></blockquote>

FIrst surfed the inside, and then went  to the line-up  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with nothing great due to mushy inside or  closing out outside  <li> Good session to further get back into shape </ul></blockquote>
