At the end of the 2nd one I sat back  down on my board, and as I laid bacck down on it I tweaked  my back. I did paddle back out and caught one more wave in  and called it a day. Hopefully it won't be too bad, but it's  clearly not "nothing". Too bad since conditions were nice and  there was no one out. </ul></blockquote>

They both left and I decided to paddle out without a leash just for a workout. Turns out, there were plenty of waves!  <li> Caught about 20 waves, with a couple of fun rights. Toward the end of the session, I took the biggest wave of the day on the head and lost my board. Had to swim quite a bit, first toward the shore (where a shortboarder on the inside handed me my hat), and then to be told by fishermen that I was swimming the wrong way and my board was way toward the harbor. Swam all the way there, got my board, caught two more nice waves and called it quit.  <li> Overall a pretty nice session, and definitely a workout </ul></blockquote>

I parked on Waimanu, walked to Ala Moana Blvd, but found that the foot bridges were closed too! So I walked to a second bridge, which unsusprisingly was close too, and then back to the car. I then drove over to the Kaiser parking lot, and found a spot!  I opted to paddle straight from there to Threes, for the workout. Good thing the Toes training is paying off. After my last wave, I paddled straight from the spot to the parking lot too. </ul></blockquote>
