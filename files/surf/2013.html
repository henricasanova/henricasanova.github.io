 <li> Threes, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. about 20 people out including Doug and Ron.  <li> Waist-high with some chest-high peaks. Clean but not very  consistent, light winds.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, mostly insiders, all pretty nice.  <li> I had not surfed Threes in years, and I went there this morning  after checking that Flies just wasn't working. I had forgotten  what a long paddle that was, and after almost 2 months without  surfing there, it definitely took a toll. Great to be out those. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Jan_23">Wed 23 Jan 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Canoes, 8:30PM-9:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry, nobody out.  <li> Ankle-high, not consistent.  <li> Caught 3 "waves"  <li> Nobody out in spite of the almost full moon, but that's because  there were no waves. Nice to be out though, just mellow, looking  at the moon and chatting. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Apr_5">Fri 5 Apr 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 7:30AM-9AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Travis on my Takayama egg, 5-6 people out including Eric, Jim, and Patrick.  <li> Waist-high+, somewhat consistent early on, but not great toward  the end.  <li> Caught something like 8 waves, including one really nice long  right that went to the stairs.  <li> Unbelievable to think that my last session was Jan 23rd. That's more  than 2 months ago. My first 2 take-offs were really lame and I  felt I didn't know how to surf anymore, but then it got better.  really noodly arms though! It was great being in the water  with Travis. Last session with Travis was 4/3/2010 at  the Cliffs in SD!! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Apr_7">Sun 7 Apr 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 4:30PM-6PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Larry and Rob, 4 other people out and then nobody out for the  second half of the session.  <li> Waist-high+, not clean or consistent, tide still too high even though  dropping.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of decent rights, but the  conditions were your typical too-high-tide Flies.  <li> One whale on the outside, 1 turtle on the outside and then on  the inside. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Apr_10">Wed 10 Apr 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Threes, 7AM-8:20AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Travis. Up to 10 other people out including Ron, Clarence. Saw Jim on the beach  as he was paddling in after breaking his leash.  <li> Waist-high+ with a few bigger sets, pretty clean and consistent. Typical Threes.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with 2 really fun rights.  <li> Really nice session, nice vibe, clean waves for the most part. Typically Threes. Could  have been a bit bigger, but after surfing so little for so long it was absolutely  perfect for me. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Apr_12">Fri 12 Apr 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Diamond Head, 9AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Geoff. At most 2-3 people out at our "break"  <li> Pretty lame conditions, with too high a tide given the swell size.  Hardly breaking on the outside. Lower tide toward the end of the  session, making waves easier to ride.  <li> Caught about 8 waves, with one decent right toward the end.  <li> Beautiful day in the water though. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Jun_5">Wed 5 Jun 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Chun's Reef, 11AM-12:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Dario on my 6'8'' Takayama Egg. About 20-25 people out.  <li> Waist-high+, not very consistent, but a few good waves.  <li> Caught a great right at some point, even though I had to weave my way  around the people sitting on the inside. Otherwise only a few somewhat  crappy rights/lefts. Beautiful day out there with great sights  of the North Shore.  <li> First session after one month off and sinus surgery. Felt pretty  weak in the water but not as bad as I thought.  <li> Sea turtles in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Jun_6">Thu 6 Jun 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Threes, 9AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Dario on my 6'8'' Takayama Egg. About 30 people out.  <li> Head-high, pretty consistent and lined up. Moderate winds.  <li> Caught about 5 waves, with a great right just after getting to the  line-up and another one halfway through the session.  <li> The crowd was a bit difficult to manage, especially being  pretty out of shape, but overall a fun session. The paddle back  was pretty exhausting though. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Jun_7">Fri 7 Jun 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Threes, 8AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Dario on my 9'2'' Stewart. About 15-20 people out.  <li> Waist-high with a few chest-high sets, pretty consistent and not  as good as yesterday but still fun. The crowd was much less of  a factor. Moderate winds  <li> Caught perhaps 10-12 waves, with only one really good right. Dario  caught pretty fun lefts.  <li> Not feeling as tired as yesterday at all, which bodes well for the  rest of Dario's stay on O`ahu.  <li> Chatted a little bit with a guy who used to live in San Diego and  recognized my South Coast board (he used to have one there and loved  it, surfing mostly Sunset Cliffs).  <li> The only "issue" was this SUPer who seemed to always get caught  in the wave with his board parallel to the wave, thus having his  massive board flying all over the place sometimes over the heads of  other surfers. We tried to stay as far away from him as possible, but  weren't always successful. At some point, I caught a pretty good left  and he was standing on the inside, right in my line, with his board  parallel to the wave, not moving at all. So I had to fade and stall  for fear of hitting him, but he got caught by the wave and his board  flew in the air and fell back really close to my board. Saw the same  thing happen to others countless time. Sort of a menace out there...  <li> One sea turtle in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Jun_8">Sat 8 Jun 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 7AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Dario on my 9'2'' Stewart. Up to 10 people out, but only 3-4 at  the end of the session including Larry and Conrad.  <li> Waist- to occ. chest-high, not consistent with long lulls, moderate  winds.  <li> Caught about 20-25 waves, with 3 pretty good rights. One one of  the best sets of the day I pulled out to let a shortboarder drop in  but he didn't make it and the wave went unridden. Oh well.  <li> Overall a pretty good session, but made longer by the fact that  Larry showed up toward the end of it, and we stayed much longer  so as to surf with him and give him a ride back.  <li> After the session, went to the Bagel shop in Kaka'ako, bought  bagels with lox cream cheese, and went for breakfast to Larry's. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Jun_10">Mon 10 Jun 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Threes, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Dario on my 9'2'' Stewart. around 10-15 other people out.  <li> Waist-high+, moderate winds, not very consistent but ok.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with nothing really exciting to report. The angle  of the swell made the wave rather sectiony (for Threes, that is). </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Jun_11">Tue 11 Jun 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Queens, 8:30PM-10PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Dario on my 9'2'' Stewart and Larry. Nobody else out.  <li> Waist-high+, at most light winds, somewhat consistent, no moon.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a few really nice rights. It was a very  fun/mellow/pleasant night surf session, all by ourselves, with waves that  were definitely decent. Ate it on several too-late take-offs as visibility  was not great without any moon out. Perfect way to conclude Dario's  Hawaiian vacation. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_Jun_18">Tue 18 Jun 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Queens, 8:30PM-10PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Larry, Dave, and Conrad. Nobody else out.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, consistent, clean, light winds at the end of the  session but otherwise mostly glassy, nice moon out.  <li> Caught something like 15 waves, with at least 5 really good rights.  Probably the best night surf conditions I've ever experienced, with  really, really fun rides lined up all the way to the inside.  <li> One one long right, Dave and I shared the wave and got all the way  to the inside, so far in in fact that we were in between coral heads  that protruded from the surface. The waves were so good that we just  tended to stay on them too long. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 2:30PM-4PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Larry, Conrad, and Larry's niece and her best friend. About 6 other people out.  <li> Waist-high, not consistent, and very oddly shaped. Really hard to catch. Moderate winds.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, with only a couple of decent ones. What odd conditions today really... oh well,  at least I logged in one session for July :/ </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 4:30PM-6PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. About 8 people out.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, not consistent, weird shapes, cross-swell.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, with only a couple of them decent. Very strange  conditions today, but at least I got wet in Honolulu before going  off island for 3 months! </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2013_July_23">Tue 23 July 2013</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Beacons, 7AM-8:30AM  <li> On an 8'6'' Becker.  <li> With Dario, Travis, and Jaime. About 15 people out.  <li> Waist-high+, glassy, not consistent, pretty weak. Really cold  water by my standards, but it was good being in San Diego  surfing again.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, nothing exceptional. </ul></blockquote>

Up to 20 people out.  <li> Waist-high+, bumpy, really junky, somewhat consistent.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with 2 really fun rights, somehow, with fun take-offs.  <li> Talked a bit with a guy in the line-up about the differences between Honolulu and San Diego  surfwise. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Guillaume. Carl, Eric, and an SUPer in the line-up  <li> Waist-high, not consistent, light winds.  <li> First session after 4+ months out of the water! Great to be  back and to catch some waves. Even though my level of out-of-shapedness is absolutely ridiculous.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, nothing special.  <li> Guillaume's first session ever, and he even stood up on his last wave. </ul></blockquote>

Up to 8-10 people out.  <li> Waist-high, not consistent, light winds.  <li> After checking Flies, which wasn't breaking, went to in-betweens.  <li> Mellow crowd, inconsistent waves but a few sets.  <li> Caught 3-4 lefts.  <li> Beautiful sunrise on Diamond Head  <li> Guillaume caught and stood up on 3 waves, on his second session ever! </ul></blockquote>

Waist-high, not very consistent, super glassy with  no wind, great visibility with full moon and few clouds.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of fun ones but rather weak  overall.  <li> As usual, great to be in the water at night, especially on such  a calm and peaceful night. </ul></blockquote>
