About 15 people at each peak.  <li> Waist-high, really inconsistent, light to moderate winds  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, nothing really great.  <li> Horribly out of paddling shape after not surfing for 2 months. Feet  caught in leash twice. Never quite in the right place. The usual  dues one pays for not getting wet. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, 8AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Nodari. About 15 people at each peak.  <li> Waist- to head-high, somewhat consistent, no winds and glassy.  <li> Caught 3 waves, including one fantastic rights that was completely  open with a nice vertical wall.  <li> Got lucky not to get stuck on the inside at all, unlike Nodari :)  <li> Totally sore from yesterday's session but somehow paddling much better  than yesterday. But at the end of the session completely exhausted and  incapable of paddling into a last wave. Caught some white to get back in.  <li> On a bigger wave I turtled, held my board, but somehow go pushed back  and hit gently some other guy on a short board. His fins got caught in my  rashgard, but no harm done... </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Abs, 1:30PM-2:30PM  <li> On Dario's 9'0  <li> With Dario. One guy out halfway through the session.  <li> Waist-high, decent, not very consistent.  <li> Botched almost all take-offs, in part due to the lack of wax on the board.  Ended up surfing 3-4 waves out of something like 10 attempted. Pretty lame.  <li> Beautiful day out there! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Tongs, 9AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. About 5-6 people out.  <li> Waist-high, windy, a bit disorganized and inconsistent.  <li> Caught about 5-6 waves, with 2 nice ones (all lefts of course).  <li> Felt like I was almost never in the right place this morning. I should really  surf Tongs more often to get used to the line up. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself and then with Eric. 1 or 2 other people out including Eric's daughter.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, windy, not consistent and disorganized, criss-crossing swells and winds, inconsistent, but still occasional nice ones coming through.  <li> Caught about 8-9 waves, with 2 very nice rights that stayed open all the way in.  <li> After about 1 hour in I decided to go in after a particularly good wave. I had been surprised to not see Eric out since his car was in the parking lot. Turns out his daughter was out but I didn't recognize her as I hadn't seen her in years.  Right when I reached the top of the stairs I met Eric and decided to go back out for 1 hour so that we could catch up. Needless to say I was dead tired after 2 hours and ended up riding the white on the way in. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. about 10 people out including Eric and Tracy.  <li> Chest- to head-high, not very consistent or organized. Quite a bit of texture in the water making it difficult to get into waves. Moderate winds.  <li> Caught 2-3 waves, nothing too great but for one good right.  <li> At the end of the session Tracy's leash plug snapped and she had to swim all the way in. bummer. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:15AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. Eric and Tracy out and one other guy who I don't think could surf, so we  add the spot to ourselves.  <li> Waist to chest-high, clean and semi-consistent, light winds, crapping out at the end of the session.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, with 3 outstanding rights that remained open all the way in.  <li> Super fun conditions, nobody out, beautiful weather, can't really ask for much more. </ul></blockquote>

Not great  due to the high tide, but decent.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, and then basically couldn't paddle anymore.  After a super long lull, ended up riding some white water back  to shore. </ul></blockquote>

Long paddle.  <li> waist- to chest-high, messy and windy.  Didn't make it to the  main peak. Caught 1 rights, got back to the line-up. noted that Scott  had gone back to Jaime's house, and paddled back. Super tired, but  that was a good workout with an awesome bbq afterwards. </ul></blockquote>

Basically, the only consistent break  was on the far inside where often the surf schools are.  <li> At least it was a beautiful weather. </ul></blockquote>

The others  were fun take-offs but mostly close-outs. Chickened out on a beautiful one, stupidly  <li> Not super in shape since it seems I am on a "surf 3 times a month" roll... </ul></blockquote>

Only other person out for most of the session was Tracy  <li> chest- to head-high+, mostly glassy, pretty consistent and lulls were welcome to paddled back out anyway  <li> Caught 6 waves, each of them with a super fun take-off and first section. Half of them stayed open nicely, those in the shoulder-high range.  <li> A few sets that where I would say up to 3ft overhead on the peak cam through, but they were almost all close-outs.  <li> Overall a great session, with only 2 friends out! Can't ask for much more. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8AM-9AM  <li> On my 9'2''  <li> By myself. Nobody out.  <li> Waist- to shoulder-high, inconsistent, mixed-up, pitching, strange and weird.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, with 2 small ones that stayed open all the way in, while  the bigger ones simply pitches and closed out.  <li> What weird conditions today, looking like a high-frequency swell was mixed up with an inconsistent ground swell. Waves were pitching a lot, causing me to eat it on my first take-off actually.  Paddling back out, I took one of the head and actually hit the bottom. Couldn't believe it.  I still don't know whether the waves this morning were powerful or weak. Oh well. At least it was beautiful weather, glassy, and nobody out, so can't complain too much. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9AM-10-30AM  <li> On my 9'2''  <li> With Nodari. 10+ people out.  <li> Chest- to shoulder-high, with a few head-high+ sets, glassy, consistent-ish, nicely lined up.  <li> Caught 8 waves, and they were _all_ lined up and beautiful, with enough  of a first section to take a high line and bottom turn around the small  closed-out section toward the inside. My next-to-last wave was absolutely  outstanding, with a long peeling wall that reeled all the way to the  inside. It seems that I was always in perfect position today in spite of  the "crowd".  <li> Caught a small insider to close a really nice Flies session. El Nino is really wreaking havoc on the environment this winter, but I guess a selfish positive side of is is head-high waves on the South shore at the end of October. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 7:15AM-8:15AM  <li> On my 9'2''  <li> With Nodari. one SUP-er out and Carl at the beginning of the session.  <li> Chest- to head-high+, glassy-ish, many close-outs, but a few nice  smaller ones that stayed open  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, which were all nice for the most part, but we had to  pick the right ones today...  <li> Got caught inside once after kicking out prematurely, but nothing too  terrible even though it was a workout.  <li> Strangely, three SCUBA divers (one instructor and two novice divers  I think) got in the water in spite of the swell!  Definitely not a good  day for them. They seemed really out of sorts, sitting in exactly the  wrong spot and being hammered by close-out sets. Not sure what they  were thinking. Most likely some dive company that didn't want to cancel  the certification dive so that they wouldn't lose their money. It's true  that they probably didn't expect head-high surf in October! </ul></blockquote>

I really need to get back  into going surfing regularly. I can't believe how lazy/busy I've become. </ul></blockquote>
