 <li> Diamond Head, 8:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, up to 30 people out on the various peaks  <li> Waist-high+, light winds, pretty bumpy, somewhat consistent but mixed up  <li> Caught 4 waves. Meant to stay out longer, but my 4th wave  was really good. A bigger set cam through and I happened to be  outside, made the drop in the pocket and had a great wall to work  with all the way to the inside. I decided to go in on a high  note, laid back down on my board, and managed to ride the  whitewater all the way to the sand! Pretty good way to start the  year. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 7:30AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, Eric showed up after 30min, nobody else out  <li> Waist-high+ with a few head-high peaks, glassy, a bit oddly shaped but somewhat consistent.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with 2 fantastic rights that lined up perfectly. The usual deal with quite a few close-outs but the occasional gem.  <li> Was great being back in the water after 3 months (!#@!?!) without  surfing. Pretty wiped out after the session, as expected. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'2''  <li> By myself, 1-2 other people in the line-up  <li> Overhead+ with some double-overhead sets, light winds, consistent  <li> Really hard to get to the line-up, really  hard to get into the big waves, and no desire to sit inside  and get the big waves on the head, which lead to a waveless session.  <li> About 20 mins to paddle out, which, considering, wasn't so bad. Tried  to catch a few waves and then got cleaned up by an outside set, all  the way back to the inside. About 40min to paddle back out, which  was particularly grueling since I was on the left side. Then  about 3min of rest, and trying to catch a wave again and again,  unsuccessfully, to eventually get cleanup up again all the way to  the inside, on the left side again! At that point, paddled in and  was done. Massive workout.  <li> Several people never made it to the line-up and just gave up. </ul></blockquote>

Light to moderate winds.  <li> Caught 12 waves, with 2-3 very night rights that had a nice wall, a bit sectiony but  enough power to make it possible to go around/through sections back to the pocket. </ul></blockquote>

Caught a nice right right away, and then  it went from big closeouts to 40 minute with uncatchable mid-size  waves. Then I caught a couple of nice rights that, somehow, lined  up. I hesitated about going back out, opted to go back out for  one more, and then took a pretty big set on the head in the  channel, 4-5 waves or so. Made it back out, then saw a bigger set  on the horizon, and barely made it over it. Right then, a peaky  right show up right where I was, and I had my best wave of the  session all the way to the stairs. So once again, overall  lame/weird/indescribable conditions at Flies, but 3 great rides  by the end of the session... </ul></blockquote>
