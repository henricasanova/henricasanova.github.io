 <li> Toes, 8:30AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, nobody out.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, choppy and messy (kona conditions).  <li> Caught 3 "waves" if you want to call them that.  <li> This session was an excuse to get back in the water before a trip to Costco after one month out of the water (but going swimming at the pool a lot). Good to see I was in pretty good shape. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, 5-10 people out including Glenn.  <li> One turtle outside.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, glassy for the most part, extremely inconsistent and weak  <li> Caught 3 "waves", but really only one that would deserve the word  <li> Was nice being back in the water after more than 2 months without surfing due to bad weather, no waves, or swimming too much in the pool! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, 2 other longboarders on the outside, a few shortboraders on the inside  <li> One monk seal on the inside.  <li> Waist-high, glassy, very inconsistent, but nice-ish (and smooth!) when coming through.  <li> Caught 5 waves, all of them pretty nice, two of which brought me all the way to the stairs. can't complain.  <li> Parking lot entrance was closed due to repaving, and I parked in a metered lot. Afterward I realized that I could've gotten in using another entrance that I didn't know existed! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9:45AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, 15-ish people out including Chris.  <li> Shoulder- to head-high+, somewhat consistent, several close-outs of course, light winds.  <li> Caught 4 waves, with two of them pretty nice. Nice to be back in the ocean. Noticed that swimming a lot, like I've been doing lately at the pool, really halpes with surfing stamina. I didn't feel tired at all, in spite of not surfing for 1 month! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, 8 people out  <li> Shoulder- to head-high+, pretty consistent and nice.  <li> Caught two waves, the first one super nice.  <li> Incredibly out of shape, expectedly, and these were a bit too heavy conditions for a mellow getting back into surfing after 3 months off!! Missed several waves due to too weak paddling, etc. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 1PM-3PM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, 2 people out  <li> shouldder- to head-high, pretty consistent but messy with wind and close-outs  <li> Caught three waves, with only one decent one.  <li> What a difficult session, being still so out of shape in conditions that weren't the easiest. I got caught inside on the paddle out, and it took me forever to reach the line-up (went harbor side!!). I was thus exhausted from the get go. Caught two waves and paddled back to the line-up more easily. Caught a non-wave in. All that swimming hasn't really prepared me for surfing it seems! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, 10 people out  <li> Shoulder- to head-high, not very consistent and impacted by the still-high tide  <li> Caught 5 waves, with the first one very nice and the others being pretty much close outs after a fun drop and section </ul></blockquote>
