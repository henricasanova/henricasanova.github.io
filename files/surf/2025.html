 <li> Toes, 8:30AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, nobody out.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, choppy and messy (kona conditions).  <li> Caught 3 "waves" if you want to call them that.  <li> This session was an excuse to get back in the water before a trip to Costco after one month out of the water (but going swimming at the pool a lot). Good to see I was in pretty good shape. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 8AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6'' South Coast  <li> By myself, 5-10 people out including Glenn.  <li> One turtle outside.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, glassy for the most part, extremely inconsistent and weak  <li> Caught 3 "waves", but really only one that would deserve the word  <li> Was nice being back in the water after more than 2 months without surfing due to bad weather, no waves, or swimming too much in the pool! </ul></blockquote>
