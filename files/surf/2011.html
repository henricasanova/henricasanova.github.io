 <li> Queens, 8:45PM-10:15PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry and Conrad, one guy out at the end.  <li> Nice conditions for a night session, with clear skies and  light winds. Too bad there weren't many waves at all.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of fun rights, but nothing  to exciting. Much more exciting was the fireworks fired from  boats right in front of us for 10 minutes. That was quite  spectacular, and we all managed to catch waves while they were  going on. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Rainbows, 8AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Eric. 4-5 people out including Mitch (!) and later Jim  <li> Nice glassy condition, but odd waves with many non-breakers. Super  nice to be out though with the fantastic view and vibe.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 2 decent rights and one good left. Nothing  spectacular, but being back in the water felt great. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2011_Feb_21">Mon 21 Feb 2011</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 11:45AM-1:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Met Larry, Rob, and Conrad in the water. Nobody else out.  <li> waist-high to chest-high, light winds, pretty consistent and  surprisingly nice.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of decent rights. My last  wave was pretty outstanding, solid waist-high+ and all the way to  the stairs. It has been a long time since I caught a wave that  brought me so close to the stairs (which are in the process of  being redone). </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:45AM-10:00AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Met Jim and Amy briefly in the line-up, then alone for  30 minutes, and then 2 girls and one guy out.  <li> Waist-high+, inconsistent, moderate winds.  <li> Caught 6 waves, the last one being a pseudo-decent right.  <li> Pretty disappointing condition given that there was a swell  yesterday. Oh well. It's not by surfing once a month that one  can hope to catch good waves. Didn't feel too out of shape, but  my timing was off on the take-off for 2-3 waves. Got better  toward the end. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2011_Apr_6">Wed 6 Apr 2011</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 8:45AM-10:00AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Jim out there, and between 3-4 people out.  <li> Waist-high to shoulder-high, not very consistent, light winds.  <li> Caught about 8 waves, with a couple of nice shoulder-high that  ended up closing out but were fun drops. Caught one very good  fully open wave halfway through the session.  <li> Pretty out of shape surfing-wise, but I didn't surf too poorly  I guess. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Beacons, 10AM-11:30AM  <li> On an 8'6''.  <li> With Dario. 10-15 people out.  <li> Waist-high++, not super clean not sort of consistent.  <li> Caught about 6-7 waves, with a couple of ok rights.  On two  chest-high lefts I was in an good position but this ripping  local (long beard, dreads, etc.) just had the place wired and  seemed to always be in the best position. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Beacons, 10:30AM-12PM  <li> On an 8'6''.  <li> With Dario, Ari, and Jaime.  <li> Waist-high, not super clean and not very consistent.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, nothing special.  <li> One a decent right Jaime did his usual drop-in. Brought me  back to old times riding right behind him on a Cali wave :)  <li> After the session, we hung out on the beach a bit, throwing rocks  and lounging. Something I just never do but perhaps should once  in a while.  <li> There was a sea lion in the line-up, but I never got a glimpse of  him. A few dolphins outside the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9AM-10:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry. Carl in the line-up along with two shortboarders and  one bodyboarder. Saw Eric after his session right when we  got to the spot.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, clean rights, long waits, light offshores.  <li> Caught 8 rights, essentially all of them great and lined up  all the way to the stairs.  <li> Quite a nice first session after more than 2 months away  from Hawai`i, and more than 3 months after my last session here. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 5:45AM-7:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Eric showed up later. 3 shortboarders out, and 2 SUPs.  one bodyboarder. Saw Eric after his session right when we  <li> Waist-high++, not super consistent, clean and glassy, weaker  than yesterday.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of decent rights. The power  of the wave was nothing like yesterday, but still nice rides  to be had.  <li> There was an helicopter hovering over the spot for 45 minutes, which  was super annoying and killed the vibe. Turns out they were looking  for a body as somebody jumped off into the ocean last night  never to be seen again. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9AM-10:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Alone for 10 minutes and with an SUP for the most  part of the session. 6 people when I got out.  <li> Waist-high+, not very clear but reasonably consistent,  moderate winds.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with 2 excellent rights lined-up all the  way to the stairs. waves were closing out a bit, but those that  remained open were really nice. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2011_Aug_4">Thu 4 Aug 2011</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 4:30PM-6PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Dan. UP to 20 people out!  <li> Waist-high+, windy, not very clean.  <li> What a shock to go from essentially and empty line-up in the  morning to what qualified as "really crowded" for Flies in the  afternoon. We ended up surfing the lefts essentially, and I  surfed extremely poorly, falling off on several take-offs.  <li> Caught essentially one good ride, but a pretty dismal session  overall. Two sessions in the same day with sort of a back  ache probably wasn't the greatest idea anyway. But this was  Dan's first session in years and it was good to go out. I am now  further comforted in the fact that surfing afternoons is not for me. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6AM-7:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Up to 5 people in the line-up, including Eric.  <li> Waist-high+, not consistent, light winds.  <li> Caught about 6-7 waves, with two decent lined-up rights in the midst  of pretty sectiony waves.  <li> Long waits today, but nice conversation in the water. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:45AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Eric and Jim in the line-up, 3 shortboarders  on the inside.  <li> Waist-high+, inconsistent, light winds initially but pretty strong  by the end of the session. Deteriorating conditions.  <li> Caught about 6-7 waves, with 3 pretty good rights. Toward the  end of the session it got so inconsistent that I had to wait  more than 20 minutes for my last wave. But that last wave  was punchy, open, lined-up, and I kicked out right at the jetty. So  no complaints really. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2011_Aug_11">Thu 11 Aug 2011</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 9AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Two other guys in the line-up.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, not consistent, light winds.  <li> Caught 10 waves. Pretty hard to catch and weak-looking, but  surprisingly walling up quite well on the inside. Had 2-3 really  fun rides in spite of the seemingly lame conditions.  <li> On the wave of the day, alone on the outside, I managed  to take off and then on the bottom turn cut it too tight and  face plant into the wall. Pretty sad, oh well. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Carl out at first, and then Eric and Patrick. 3  shortboarders on the inside.  <li> Waist-high+, not consistent, moderate winds. A few nicer  waves coming through once in a while, but oddly angled.  <li> Caught about 5 waves, including two decent ones, but nothing  great.  <li> I really felt terribly sluggish and low on energy today, and  didn't surf well. In particular, I failed to get into to  nice waves that had shoulder-high peaks. Will be better next time  I guess. </ul></blockquote>

Two other people out, and about 10 paddling  out right before our last wave.  <li> knee- to waist-high, extremely inconsistent, glassy and beautiful  weather.  <li> Caught perhaps 5 waves, and spent most of the session chatting  with Larry. </ul></blockquote>
