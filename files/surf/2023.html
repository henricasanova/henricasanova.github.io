The first one was a perfect left, with some size, completely lined up all the way. By the time I got back to the line-up, winds had picked up and conditions had changed. From then on it was very inconsistent with very hard to catch waves... still managed to catch a few, and my last one in, considering, wasn't bad.  <li> Pod of dolphins on the outside. Honus in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

Caught a couple of big ones including one that was a couple of feet overhead on the peak, and I miraculously made the drop, probably one of the steepest I have done, at least on this 9'6'' beast. Survived the drop and then total close-out explosion behing be. Pretty exhilirating if not the best ride. Went in on a small insider that brought me to the stairs. </ul></blockquote>

The traffic due to the Kakahako Farmer's Market and an event in the Kakahako beach park was insane. And then of course it got super crowded in a line-up with few waves.

At about 8:35 I was told that all three meetings were canceled! So I worked for a bit, went back home, and went to Flies. The parking lot was FULL (which I guess happens now?), so I parked on the street (found a "dead" meter, so didn't have to pay!). A lot of hassle for a rising-tide weak-swell session, but all worth it due to that one great wave that came out of nowhere! </ul></blockquote>
