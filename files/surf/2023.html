 <li> Toes, 9:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, between 3 and 8 people out  <li> waist-high+, almost no wind at first, and then the wind picked up  <li> Caught 4 waves. The first one was a perfect left, with some size, completely lined up all the way. By the time I got back to the line-up, winds had picked up and conditions had changed. From then on it was very inconsistent with very hard to catch waves... still managed to catch a few, and my last one in, considering, wasn't bad.  <li> Pod of dolphins on the outside. Honus in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 8:30AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, up to 10 other people out  <li> waist-high+, completely glassy for the most part, good at first and getting less consistent as time went on  <li> Caught about 8 waves with two nice lefts early on in the session. After that things got more difficult, with most waves very hard to catch. Such a beautiful morning out there though. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 8:30AM-9:45AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, up to 15 other people out at first and then down to only a few  <li> waist-high+, glassy at first and then choppier and choppier, pretty consistent buyt for a lull toward the end  <li> Caught about 10 waves, all lefts, with one great one that was lined up all the way in. Overall a pretty good session before what, we're being told, will be many windy days in a row. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9AM-10:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, between 4 and 8 other people out including Val  <li> waist-high to overhead, glassy, not super consistent, and a bit twisted and weird.  <li> Caught about 8 waves, most of them in the mid-range size and often lined up. Caught a couple of big ones including one that was a couple of feet overhead on the peak, and I miraculously made the drop, probably one of the steepest I have done, at least on this 9'6'' beast. Survived the drop and then total close-out explosion behing be. Pretty exhilirating if not the best ride. Went in on a small insider that brought me to the stairs. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9:30AM-11AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Nodari and Rolf, at first 4 people out and at the end about 20  <li> Waist- to chest-high, consistent-ish but a bit ugly due to quickly rising winds  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of decent rights  <li> Went out on a weekend as it was Rolf's last days in Hawaii, but man, what an ordeal. The traffic due to the Kakahako Farmer's Market and an event in the Kakahako beach park was insane. And then of course it got super crowded in a line-up with few waves. On the way home I had to go to Costco and that was insane as well.  Never going out on a Saturday again! </ul></blockquote>

After the session, went to Alex's house for his birthday dinner! </ul></blockquote>
