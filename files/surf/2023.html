<h2> <a name="2023_Jan_11">Wed 11 Jan 2023</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Toes, 9:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, between 3 and 8 people out  <li> waist-high+, almost no wind at first, and then the wind picked up  <li> Caught 4 waves. The first one was a perfect left, with some size, completely lined up all the way. By the time I got back to the line-up, winds had picked up and conditions had changed. From then on it was very inconsistent with very hard to catch waves... still managed to catch a few, and my last one in, considering, wasn't bad.  <li> Pod of dolphins on the outside. Honus in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 8:30AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, up to 10 other people out  <li> waist-high+, completely glassy for the most part, good at first and getting less consistent as time went on  <li> Caught about 8 waves with two nice lefts early on in the session. After that things got more difficult, with most waves very hard to catch. Such a beautiful morning out there though. </ul></blockquote>
