 <li> Toes, 9:30AM-10AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, between 3 and 8 people out  <li> waist-high+, almost no wind at first, and then the wind picked up  <li> Caught 4 waves. The first one was a perfect left, with some size, completely lined up all the way. By the time I got back to the line-up, winds had picked up and conditions had changed. From then on it was very inconsistent with very hard to catch waves... still managed to catch a few, and my last one in, considering, wasn't bad.  <li> Pod of dolphins on the outside. Honus in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 8:30AM-9:30AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, up to 10 other people out  <li> waist-high+, completely glassy for the most part, good at first and getting less consistent as time went on  <li> Caught about 8 waves with two nice lefts early on in the session. After that things got more difficult, with most waves very hard to catch. Such a beautiful morning out there though. </ul></blockquote>

Overall a pretty good session before what, we're being told, will be many windy days in a row. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9AM-10:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself, between 4 and 8 other people out including Val  <li> waist-high to overhead, glassy, not super consistent, and a bit twisted and weird.  <li> Caught about 8 waves, most of them in the mid-range size and often lined up. Caught a couple of big ones including one that was a couple of feet overhead on the peak, and I miraculously made the drop, probably one of the steepest I have done, at least on this 9'6'' beast. Survived the drop and then total close-out explosion behing be. Pretty exhilirating if not the best ride. Went in on a small insider that brought me to the stairs. </ul></blockquote>

The traffic due to the Kakahako Farmer's Market and an event in the Kakahako beach park was insane. And then of course it got super crowded in a line-up with few waves. On the way home I had to go to Costco and that was insane as well.  Never going out on a Saturday again! </ul></blockquote>

The first one was just beautiful, with no wind, and lined up. After that it went downhill with strengthening winds and rising tide. Struggle to catch a last wave due to being pretty tired. </ul></blockquote>
