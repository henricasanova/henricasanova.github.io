Clarence and John.  <li> waist- to chest-high, moderate winds, not very consistent  in part due to the high tide, but still some nice waves  coming through.  <li> Caught 10 waves, with a couple of pretty fun ones. Sort of  unexpected after so many days with junky stormy surf...  <li> It was Craig's first session in Hawai`i and it was quite  a change from his Oregon's beach break, starting with  the paddle all the way out there. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2009_Jan_22">Thu 22 Jan 2009</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Threes, 6:30AM-7:40AM  <li> on my 9'6''  <li> By myself. Alone for 1/2 hour, then 2 spongers, then 2 longboarders.  <li> knee- to waist-, light winds, rain for 10 minutes halfway through,  sort of clean but a bit odd due to the swell being a wrap, thus  having a lot of West in it.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, including a couple of semi-fun one. Nothing  too exciting though.  <li> On the best wave I took off on, that longboarder totally dropped in  on me. I should really have said something but I was just too stunned.          He was a really good surfer actually, and he made eye contact with  me as he was dropping in. I was sure he was going to back off, and then  he made the drop. I had to slow down and straighten out a bit, which left me in the white. I could definitely have made that section and I guess he  thought I wouldn't make it. But still, the deliberateness of it  and the lack of apology after the fact was a bit stunning.  <li> One sea lion in the line-up, briefly. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9:45AM-11AM.  <li> on my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> By myself. Two people out, one teaching the other.  <li> Waist-high, choppy, ugly, windy, but somehow some waves coming  through.  <li> Caught 10+ waves, with only a couple that were decent ride, for  some definition of decent.  <li> On my first wave I pearled in some chop, and lost my board. I  ended up swimming in and it quickly became clear I had gone too far  in. Some guy on the shore pointed out to the board that was outside  and toward the left. Pretty good workout I guess. Didn't lose the  board after that.  <li> A bunch of divers everywhere, which was a bit unnerving when they  were either on the inside or in the waves looking like huge sharks. </ul></blockquote>

Eric and Clarence later.  <li> Waist-high, slow, light to moderate winds, but a few sets.  <li> It was pretty crowded. That Coast Guard guy who comes to Threes  pretty often brought 7, yes, 7 of his Coast Guard friends. Totally  inappropriate really.. But I have to say they stayed closer to  the left.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with nothing to write home about, but we  could tell that the swell was building. It could be decent tomorrow.  <li> Good conversations with Jim and Eric in the water.  <li> Flying fish in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

Faces were really open  today, which was great. I was pretty out of shape and I just couldn't get into  one of the nicest waves of the day, which was pretty sad. Justin was like: "ok, you've  got to go sit on the inside for 15 minutes now" :)  <li> Fred did ok, and caught a nice wave on his stomach. Later on it got a little but  crowded and he stayed on the ever annoying inside left. </ul></blockquote>

<h2> <a name="2009_Feb_14">Sat 14 Feb 2009</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 4:30PM-6PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Nobody out.  <li> knee- to waist, very inconsistent, sloppy, not breaking much,  moderate winds.  <li> I may have reached the epitome of surfing zen, or brain-damage,  depends how you look at it. Because the fact that I was all happy  getting out of the water after this session is pretty unreal.  <li> I showed up at Flies just to check the surf, in spite of the  rising tide and the high wind, there was a chance for the North  wrap to produce some size. But when I showed up in the usually pretty  empty parking lot it was utterly full, with 1/3 of it blocked. There was  that Valentine's Day party/concert going on in the park, probably a  Japanese-themed event given the crowd. So instead of being able to check  the surf calmly and go home after seeing the expected chop, I went around  and around, missing a spot by just a tiny bit 5 times. It started  to be really, really annoying, and as I was going to give up I figured  I could park a little further away and check the surf. It seemed stupid  not to, after wasting 20 minute in the lot. So I parked the car on the other side  of the park, and left my board there as I went to check the surf. When I finally  reached the top of the hill I saw that beautiful chest-high set breaking with nobody  out! So I immediately raced back to the car, not wanting to leave my board  unattended too long, geared up and ran back to the spot... to  find it... absolutely lame. Turns out, only one other set like that one came in  and most of it was pretty ridiculous.  Furthermore, the stereo from the  party was blasting and given the winds I could totally hear it from the  deserted line-up, most of it some dude yelling encouragements to the crowd to get  them more excited about love and shit I guess. I ended up catching about 5 non-waves, and 2 waves, with  one of these two sort of mildly fun I have to say. I missed the nicest set because, of course,  I was too far inside.  <li> In spite of all this, and perhaps due to the stunning sunset, I got out of the water  mentally refreshed and pretty damn happy. Go figure. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 4:30PM-6PM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. One guy out and then Conrad with two friends of his.  <li> Waist-high, inconsistent, choppy, moderate to strong winds.  <li> Pretty windy out there but once in a while there would be a somewhat decent set.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 3 or 4 that were fun with decently long rides, although  nothing matching "good" Flies.  The wind, although impressive, wasn't too much of a factor.  <li> Today I was reading the waves pretty well, and Conrad's friends were saying that  I had the place wired. Pretty funny, but it's true that considering the conditions  I was myself sort of surprised to be getting decent rides. </ul></blockquote>

The board I got was a piece of crap, beat-up,  loose-fin, 9'2'' epoxy.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, with nothing great. The board was pretty  hard to maneuver really, but at least it was good to surf  a spot on another island.  <li> Serge had a very hard time, mostly physically, but hopefully got something out of it. </ul></blockquote>

But overall fun.  Hopefully will be able to get back in the water with better  weather during the week. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2009_March_24">Tue 24 March 2009</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Pacific Beach, San Diego, 8AM-9AM  <li> On Kathy's 8'6'' 3-fin Ellington.  <li> By myself, 25 people out on the main peak, at most 1-2 elsewhere.  <li> Glassy, waist- to occasional chest-high, high-frequency,  many close outs, very hard to get into waves.  <li> When I showed up at the beach it was clear that the main  sand bar was working, although at the edge of closing out.  There were 25 guys on that peak, dropping in and getting the  occasional good ride on chest-high ones that were  pseudo-barreling. I opted to go South of them.  <li> The paddle out was a pain in the ass. I had forgotten those  MB/PB paddles with high frequency wind swell crap. After 20 minutes  I was finally out, very tired due to my being pretty out of  shape, but happy to be out. And then, I was pretty much shut out,  along with most people who were not on the main peak. A lot of  doubles, triples, you name it. Completely impossible to  get into them on the outside, and closing out bad on the  inside. I was next to  a longboarder for a while, and I think that neither of us even  paddled for a wave for 30 minutes straight. Shortboarders weren't faring  much better unless they were fighting it out with the crowd at the  peak, where 4 waves out of 5 were closing out anyway.  Very odd  conditions, but brought back memories of bad wind swells.  I  managed to drop in on a close-out and made it in after 1h,  without having surfed a single wave, and pretty cold by that  point due to sitting around in the water.  <li> Beautiful morning out there. 3 dolphins on the outside. Tons of  birds. </ul></blockquote>

<h2> <a name="2009_March_27">Fri 27 March 2009</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>

Caught 5 waves, with  a decent right and a decent left, but not much otherwise. Waves  were very difficult to get into and on the sets it was pretty  hard to be in the right place. Dario scored 4 set waves  somehow and was pretty happy.  <li> We paddled back in at dark, which was pretty cool, and then walked  back to Ari's place over the tracks. Overall a pleasant session. </ul></blockquote>

Otherwise, I was completely loopy  today and surfed pretty poorly, very odd, but super happy.  <li> 3-4 dolphins, with a baby swimming next to his mother,  less than 10 feet from us. </ul></blockquote>

My last wave was also pretty good,  the biggest I caught all day, and it brought me all the way to the  beach. I really like this board and perhaps getting one similar  wouldn't be such a bad idea.  <li> After the session we had the usual great breakfast at People's.  <li> 1 sea lion on the outside. </ul></blockquote>

Only Eric out.  <li> Waist-high, from light to moderate winds, pretty choppy, not  consistent with a few sets once in a while.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, all rights, with a few decent ones that  took me all the way to the inside. It looked like the swell  forecast for tomorrow was starting to fill in at times.  <li> After surfing in cold water, with a wetsuit, on a shorter board,  I felt very strong today and paddled for everything that moved  pretty successfully. The usual California-training effect.  <li> Good conversation out there with Eric during the many lulls. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2009_April_1">Wed 1 April 2009</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Threes, 6:15AM-7:45AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Eric came out, as well as a guy on an SUP for 1/2 the session.  <li> knee- to waist-high, windy, inconsistent, pretty weak. Overall worse than yesterday.  <li> Caught about 15 waves although at the beginning of the session I  was starting to doubt I would catch any. But, as usual, a few sets  came through. In fact, a very nice 3-wave chest-high set came out  of nowhere toward the end of the session, but of course we weren't  in position.  <li> Conditions seems to improve throughout the session, but the wind  started to blow stronger as well, oddly enough. On my last wave  I actually had a really fun drop, and once again felt pretty happy  after spending time in the water.  <li> Best line of the morning: "Man, if tomorrow the forecasts doesn't  say at least 3 feet, I'll just pop a viagra and go back to the  horizontal boogie dance floor". </ul></blockquote>

Much better than  yesterday, with an especially good, consistent 1/2 hour.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with several good rights and especially  a nice almost chest-high one that was nicely lined-up. Screwed up a couple  of late take-offs, and we missed the rare chest-high outside sets.  <li> Overall a very nice session, beautiful morning and nice  conversations in the water with Jim, who, incidentally, last  month had the privilege of surfing the last Super Ferry wave out  here. </ul></blockquote>

Mitch for a while but he ended up paddling over to Paradise.  <li> knee- to waist-high, choppy, weak, inconsistent, pretty windy, ugly. Pretty much terrible conditions. So much for that supposed swell.  <li> Caught 10 "waves", with only one or two that provided what can be called a ride.  <li> This was one of the worst days I've seen out there, but at least there were a bunch of people to chat with. </ul></blockquote>

Light winds and more or less glassy.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with one nice chest-high one that was lined  up. And in fact, I caught many waves all the way to the inside today,  somewhat surprisingly. In fact, even some weak waist-high ones ended  up having a decent inside section. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2009_April_9">Thu 9 April 2009</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6:15AM-8:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Met up with Eric, Rick, Justin, and a few other people. Up to 10 people out at some point.  <li> waist- to occasional chest-high, not consistent, glassy.  <li> Met with Eric in the parking lot as we arrived together.  Unfortunately he locked his keys inside his van, so he went back  after meeting a friend who had a cellphone. So I paddled out alone,  and was way to inside when the first decent set showed up.  <li> Overall probably better than yesterday but somehow I was a bit tired  and didn't catch too many waves. Perhaps a total of 10. One of  them was a great, great right, chest-high, really well-lined up,  that brought me all the way in. I had a couple of other decent  ones. But I paddled for many waves that I didn't catch.  <li> Nice conversation in the line-up with Rick who's going to  spend 1 month in Italy this Summer.  <li> Caught a pretty nice wave and paddled in with Eric. We tried to find  a coat hanger or some other way to get the keys out of his van, but  no luck. Earlier he had left a message to his wife who was on her  way so I left him there, in his trunks, in the parking lot. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2009_April_10">Fri 10 April 2009</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 6:15AM-8:15AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> By myself. Met up with Eric, Rick, Justin, the usual weekend dawn  patrollers because today was Good Friday, later Jordan and his  shortboarder friend.  From 5 to 10 people out overall.  <li> Waist- to occasional chest-high, very inconsistent, pretty week, glassy.  <li> Definitely weaker and less consistent than yesterday, but at least  glassy.  <li> Caught about 20 waves, with none of the very occasional bigger chest-high  ones. Those were mostly close-outs anyway, but there were a few that were  absolutely perfect. Caught many waist-high rights, with a few decent ones  that went all the way to the stairs. But mostly a lot of waiting on the  inside.  <li> About halfway through, as I was paddling back with Rick from one of the  long rides to the stairs, we saw a pretty horrifying scene. A bigger set came  through and the second wave was a total close-out. Justin was right in the  impact zone, and that other guy whom I'd never seen before tried to drop in.  I don't really know what he was thinking because the wave was  already closed out all the way. Furthermore, if at all it was more open  on the left, but the guy went right basically right on top of Justin. The  guy fell of the board of course since the take-off was unmakable and Justin  dove deep. The guy's board went right over Justin's and it looked pretty  bad really. I mean, even if the guy wanted to do a stupid take-off on  a close-out for the heck of it, why do that when there's somebody  in the impact zone right in front. Anyway, they got back on their  board and Rick and I were pretty horrified. 5 minutes later I  paddled over to Justin and although he felt there was no damage  to his board I thought I saw a ding on the rail. And yes, there  was a pretty big gash all the way through the foam. Quite the bummer.  <li> Toward the end I was getting pretty tired after paddling for so many  measly waves. I opted to paddle for a pretty iffy one and ended up  paddling my ass off for like 15-20 seconds to finally make it after  much arching up and pushing down on the board. At that point I was  so tired that I was barely able to get up on the board. It was pretty  funny really.  <li> Apparently there was a pod of dolphins on the outside, but I  never caught a glimpse of them. </ul></blockquote>

I was lucky to be exactly in the  right spot on the only clean chest-high peak of the session and rode it all the way to the wall.  Once again, one wave saves the session. Caught a few lefts that didn't really hold, and my  last right wasn't too terrible but quasi closing out.  <li> Apparently it was great out here yesterday, but there was  a contest going on, so good thing I decided to take the day off.  <li> Great morning out there, beautiful weather, nice conversations. After the session Eric and I had  lunch at Kaka'ako kitchen, which was really good because during the entire session the smell  of the hibachis on the shore was driving us nuts. </ul></blockquote>

Jim just decided to paddle in actually, that's how bad it was.  <li> A pod of spinner dolphins outside, with much jumping/spinning action. Beautiful rainbow and sunrise. </ul></blockquote>

Pretty hard to read and get into the waves. Perfectly glassy and beautiful out there.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with only two real ones, two decent  waist-high+ ones that I was lucky enough to see coming. During the  session one beautiful shoulder-high rogue wave came through, but  of course I was inside.  <li> Pretty hard conditions for Benoit, but he managed to catch a few waves  without really standing up.  <li> Justin paddled out on his funboard because both his longboards got  damaged in the same way in two days. The first one I talked about  in a previous report. The second one happened about the same way,  at Flies, but more of a complete accident.  <li> At the end Jim was setting up on the shore and we met Eric who was  coming from Threes and was going to just get wet again at Flies.  Threes was lame and crowded. So I guess, all in all, Flies wasn't  too bad a choice. We need waves at some point though! </ul></blockquote>

At most 5 people out  including Conrad and his friend Greg.  <li> waist- to occ. shoulder-high, glassy at first and later  light on-shores, not very consistent, but better than yesterday  although most bigger sets closed out.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 3-4 of good rights that  lined up all the way to the stairs. Did a super steep  take-off on a semi-close-out shoulder-high wave toward the end  of the session and barely made it, which was sort of fun.  <li> One odd flying fish/eel in the line-up. Also, we were getting  bitten by what Jordan called "sea fleas" (the day after Clarence  said it was much more likely to be a jellyfish than "sea mites"). Pretty painful and  then itchy for a while. Odd. Jordan said that for him it  itches the whole day. Luckily for me it lasted only 5 minutes  or so after each bite. At some point I had to put my leash on  my knee because I had gotten bitten right under it.  <li> Overall a pretty decent session, although halfway through the  conditions changed really noticeably, and not for the better. </ul></blockquote>

Waves were pretty slow today and with the  long lulls in between the session was pretty contemplative. A lot  of talking/joking in the line-up to pass the time. Absolutely stunning  morning though.  <li> When I showed up Justin and Eric were looking at the line-up and there  were a few suspect looking ripples on the outside. Eric was sort of  psyching Justin out telling him it was a shark. That was hilarious.  Justin ended up waiting for us as we went back to the car to get  our boards. </ul></blockquote>

Many rides took me all the way  to the stairs actually, but because of the angle of the swell  I can't say that there were any outstanding waves. A lot of  fun though on a beautiful morning.  <li> It was kind of surprising to see up to 15 people out in the line-up  this morning, but after 7:30 it really emptied out. I guess  it pays off to go for a marathon session. Feeling pretty tired as  I am typing this. </ul></blockquote>

Really a wonderful night session with  good visibility. A bit crowded at time, but ok.  <li> There was one guy out that was incredible. Local dude,  talking a lot, yelling in glee and clapping as he was catching  waves. Then he would call out waves for people yelling  something that sounded like "oink oink oink". He would randomly  give yoda-like advice to hapless people sitting in the line-up  ("look at the shadows... they're not shadows...they're waves").  We were all laughing most of the time, he was pretty outrageous.  At some point some guy on an SUP showed up in the line, and  the crazy guy pretty much told him to fuck off. They talked  for a while and the crazy guy wasn't having none of it. Afterward  he told us: "you guys have to speak up too, fuck them  paddleboarders!" He was a really good surfer though. As I was  paddling back from a good right he caught a wave and did a  cutback right next to me. There was a bodyboarder taking  pictures in the water, and I saw his flash go off right then...  It would be cool to see that picture. </ul></blockquote>

Then down to only 3 toward the end.  <li> waist-high+ with a few head-high sets. No consistent but reasonably  clean. Light winds.  <li> Caught about 20 waves.  <li> It was an odd session for me. Initially I didn't catch much at all, in  part due to the crowd. Then halfway through the session I had a patch  during which I caught 5 or 6 absolutely great rights in a row, all  open and with some power, making the others jealous.  So overall a really good session and quite the workout.  <li> Toward the end Justin and I, and that other guy, were the only  ones out, and we made the mistake of trying to get just one  last wave. It seemed all dead and flat, due to the tide coming in,  and we were getting ready to paddle back in. Then, out of nowhere,  a head-high+ set showed up. We were too far inside. As I tried to  paddle over it it was clear I was right in the impact zone. I  turtled over 2 waves, lost my board on the second one, and on  the third, bigger wave, I just ditched the board since nobody was  around and dove down. As the wave was getting over me I felt the leash  snap. The other guy out retrieved my board for me and I paddled in.  The wave was big but nothing crazy. I guess the  leash was old... Anyway, it's now time to go get a new one.  <li> Intense rainbow halfway through the session. </ul></blockquote>

I managed to be the first  one out this morning and to catch a wave with nobody in the water.  <li> Caught about 12 waves, including two great shoulder-high ones  that stayed open until the very last section. Not sure how that  happened, good karma I guess, but I was in perfect position on  two of the best waves of the day I think.

Super steep but holding wall, making each  section on a super-high line. Just a great wave. I had  another one, not as big, but super clean as well, later in  the session.

That was exhausting and  didn't work well. Then Larry and I swapped boards. So I was on his  6'6'' fish for 1/2 hour. Pretty exhausting too, although I managed  to catch two waves. I had a pretty hard time getting that board going  though. Still, a great experience.  <li> When Larry and I swapped boards back we were on the inside, which in  retrospect wasn't a good idea. As soon as I got back on my 9'6'' I saw  this bigger set on the horizon. I barely made it over it while Larry,  of course, remained stuck on the inside. Pretty funny really.  <li> Toward the end of the session, back on my boards, I caught a few  decent waves. But Eric definitely got the wave of the day.

Toward the end it got pretty  lame and we paddled in. There were still a few waves once an again  though. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 5PM-6:15PM  <li> On my 7'6''  <li> With Larry, Conrad, and Greg, nobody out but for two SUPs early on.  <li> knee-high, horribly inconsistent with perhaps 5-6 breaking waves  the whole session in spite of the dropping tide. Sort of choppy too.  <li> Just went out completely randomly not expecting much, and not  getting much in the end. Although Larry caught 2 waves early on  on his fish, the rest of us were shut out for ever. In fact,  Greg and Conrad didn't catch one wave and paddled in. Right  after that I caught 3 pseudo-waves, which was sort of amazing given  the conditions and the board.  <li> Toward the end, it was so weak that boar wakes created all sorts  of criss-crossing waves in the line-up.  <li> Beautiful sunset though. Sort of a soulful session in a way, just  being in the water and watching the sunset was kind of cool. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Haleiwa, 6:30AM-8:30AM  <li> On my 8'8''  <li> With Larry, Conrad, John, and Gloria. From 10 to 20 people out.  <li> chest-high with a few head-high sets, very fat and slow, tide rising,  not consistent, glassy.  <li> It was extremely hard to catch waves today and it was  definitely longboard/SUP day. Caught 4 waves only. Luckily  my last one brought me right to the beach in the right spot.  <li> It was fun being in the water, but since most waves didn't break  it got frustrating, especially when finding oneself on the inside  of the rare bigger sets. Oh well.  <li> Several turtles in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

It ended up being a goofy fun session during which we  attempted to have as many people per wave as possible (we managed  at best 4 people on a wave). Fun conversations in the water, some  about this blog which means I need to be careful about what I write  now... so anyway, I totally shredded today with around 10 waves :)  <li> Amazing weather this morning and a pretty good way to start the day  in spite of the lack of waves. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6AM-8AM  <li> On my 9'6''.  <li> With Larry, up to 15 people out, including Jay, Justin, Conrad. 3 SUPs  paddled out toward the end of the session.  <li> chest- to 1-ft overhead, glassy, not very consistent with several  long lulls.  <li> Caught 6 waves, almost all of them outstanding. In fact, my  first wave was head-high, completely open, and took me all the  way to the inside. Every section was makable until the end.  My last wave in was a close-out, but I took it anyway  because I was just getting tired and  Larry had already gotten out of the water.  <li> Morad and his friend were there again taking pictures, not sure if  they got a shot of me or not. Not sure I want to see it.  <li> The beginners from yesterday were out today, on foam boards. Let's  just say they didn't stay long.  <li> During big sets, the channel was closing out. Paddling out  had to be timed well. On my next-to-last wave I was debating  whether to go back out for a last wave or not. That's when Justin  went in after doing his "surf around the jetty" thing.  Right then  one of the biggest sets loomed on the outside and the channel closed  out at 6-ft. Some guy had just paddled out an was right next to me on  a shortboard. I turned over and managed to hang onto my board, while  he duck-dived. Not sure what happened but his board was snapped  in half and his leash broke. The guy hadn't been in the water  for more than 1 minute!  I managed to make it outside quite quickly  and Jay and I were basically on our own for 10 minutes. </ul></blockquote>

Nothing great, but four a couple of decent one.  A few late take-offs on close-outs that I didn't see coming. The joy  of going to a "new" spot. Really a hard wave to read and  definitely not a good spot to bring a beginner to. Olivia managed  to catch a little bit of white water on the inside, but it wasn't  really a good session for her. Flies would have been better but it  was barely breaking.  <li> A few very good SUPers in the line-up, including that guy riding  an 8'0'' who was very impressive. Very mellow vibe in the line-up,  and we talked a bit with a guy whose mother's from Tahiti and who  spoke French quite well.  <li> At least it was a beautiful morning. </ul></blockquote>

As I got to the  spot first there was a single guy out there, and yes, it must have  sucked for him to see 6 people paddle out and ruin his soulful night  session. I said "hello" and was met with dead silence. Then, as he  paddled for a wave he told Conrad: "get out of the way brother". So  the vibe got instantly a bit aggro. We let him have his pick of  waves and he paddled back in after about 1/2 hour. That was good because  there were many 1-wave sets and with an aggro guy out that doesn't  leave much space. Later on two other guys came out, the total  opposite, talking and hooting in the line-up.  <li> Toward the end of the session the lack of visibility really got  ridiculous and we managed to get waves in. </ul></blockquote>
