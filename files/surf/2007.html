 <li> Threes, Fours, Kaiser's, Rockpile, 6:30AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 9'2'', no leash  <li> By myself, 3 people at Fours, 5 at Kaiser's, 3 at Rockpile  <li> Ankle- to Knee-high. Glassy.  <li> Paddled out for the workout mostly. No waves at Threes, and I opted  to paddle West for once. So I paddled to what I think  is Fours, where there were two shortboarders. I continued on to  what I am pretty sure was Kaiser's. Waves were lame but that place  seemed to just generate waist-high waves on this completely flat  day. It was completely owned by 5 shortboarders of course. Then I  went on to the next spot where there were two longboarders. I am not  sure whether that's Rockpile or not. It looked more like  leftovers from Kaiser's, with only the left "working". I caught  a nice knee-high left, and decided I was too tired and didn't  have enough time to continue on to the next stop (Rockpile?). So  I hung out there, caught an ankle-high left and paddled all the  way back. Quite the workout but a stunning morning once again.  One day I'll have to really get those spots straight. </ul></blockquote>

Nothing too  exciting but fun. Getting in better shape already, although my  surfing sort of sucks right now. Had a hard time making sections.  <li> As usual stunning sunrise although this morning was a bit cold. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 9:00AM-10:00AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> With Larry, nobody out.  <li> knee-high, inconsistent, choppy, weak.  <li> Pretty much ridiculous to paddle out in these conditions, but it  was such a beautiful day and it was a good workout.  <li> Caught about 5 waves, with only 2 real ones, which were lame anyway.  <li> At some point, this guy paddled out with a child and a bag on  his long board. They went beyond the line-up to meet up with  two canoes. After a while, the guy paddled back and had left  his daughter on one of the canoes. He told us that he had just scattered  hit mom's ashes in the ocean with his daughter and friends. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Rainbows, 6:45AM-8:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> With Eric, 2 then 3 other people out  <li> chest-high, windier as time went on, not very consistent and shifty, but nice waves  coming through regardless.  <li> Finally made it to Rainbows. Way back when I had surfed the inside there, which people called  Kualoa (because it's next to Kualoa ranch). Rainbows is just the outside reef.  <li> Eric explained that the line-up is always shifty and indeed it is. No point in chasing  waves. Just sit where you are in the general line-up area and wait. Waves are odd. Basically  one must be on the peak to drop in, even on a longboard. The take-off is steep but the shoulder  is soft and slow, so one must hug the white water. There is  still a wall to work with though. Then, the inside walls up and gets  pretty fast (nothing crazy though). Very long rides and the paddle back takes some time.  The take-off is a bit  difficult because one really has to take off in the most critical part of the wave. So it  looks like it's going to be really sketchy, but in fact it's not that bad. On the first couple  waves I pulled out because I thought it was going to close out, when in fact it was perfect.  <li> Caught 6-7 waves, with a couple of very good/long rights and one great left. On the rest  I didn't stay close enough to he white and ended up losing the wave.  <li> It was a great experience out there, in turn glassy, sunny,  rainy, windy, sunny again. The landscape  is absolutely stunning, with Chinaman's hat on the left (when  looking back to shore), a steep hill right in the back of the  spot, and a beautiful valley to the right of that, bright green,  with a few rainbows. The shore is lined up with coconut trees.  Quite the tropical setting.  <li> So, overall, yes, the wave isn't great, but there was size and I had tons of fun. Besides today it was probably one of the few rideable spots  on the island (North Shore: 30-40 feet, junky; West Shore: 15-20 feet, blown out; South Shore: dead AND blown out). Eric  is definitely on top of the "let's pick a spot" thing on O`ahu. I owe him. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Rainbows, 6:45AM-8:15AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> With Eric, nobody out  <li> Waist- to chest-high, _incredibly_ windy.  <li> Eric and I were probably the only two insane people out this  morning on the island. I showed up and basically I couldn't  open the car door because of a squall. Off-shore/side-shore mix,  with clouds racing in the sky. I was early somehow and after  10 minutes I felt that this was just ridiculous and that Eric  would never show up (he lives on the windward side and the winds  must have been howling at his house as well). So I started  driving back to town and after 1 mile I saw Eric's car coming  this way. I u-turned and met up with him at the spot. We had coffee  in the back of his jeep, and looked at the spot. I could tell he was  willing to paddle out, and although it seemed completely insane  I agreed.  <li> Made it to the line-up, which was basically a minefield. I have  never been out in conditions even remotely close to being this windy.  The wave plumes were 10ft in the air and were racing across the line-up for hundreds of feet,  hitting us like a slap in the face. Incredibly we managed to drop  in a few waves for very bumpy rides, some of them long, some on which we would  literally be blown off to the back. A couple times I got picked  up off the board by the wind. Another time I couldn't turn the  board back up after turtling because of the wind and had to wait for the  squall to pass. Watching Eric trying to catch wave was like a vision from some  "lost at sea and about to die" movie. It was so insane that I actually giggled  the whole session and had a great time.  I still caught about 5 waves, with 2 long ones.  <li> The lefts were completely impossible because right into the side-shore wind.  I ate it  on every left. At some point I was right on the peak of a head-high left and  just had to let it go.  Eric paddled over and yelled in my ear that he had enough and was  tired. I could barely hear him and thought that yes, it was a  good idea to paddle back in or catch a last one as opposed to waiting for being completely exhausted. (Surprisingly  I was doing fine and paddling like a maniac though.) And indeed, I  was able to catch a small right that wasn't too bad (meaning it  felt like skiing on a mogul field but I could stay on). I  turned back and saw Eric try to catch a chest-high left (I though  "is he insane?"). He dropped  in, was bounced back up by huge  chop, fell back down on his board, was bounced back up, fell to  the side of his board which then was picked up 5ft in the air by  the wind, and which fell back right on his head. It happened  really fast but he was back on, paddling, and with his thumb up.  I was already planning to tow him back to shore with broken ribs and  skull and thinking ahead on what the best towing strategy would  be like (which was attaching both leashes together and me  dragging him on his board in the crazy chop). But no, turns out he  didn't actually fall on his board but right next to it. We made it  to shore, his head was fine, and he just had a pressure ding on  his board.  <li> So in the end,this wasn't really surfing, more like some extreme water sport  adventure, but I had a total blast laughing for the whole  session. I just wish I had had a waterproof camera to take shots  from the back of the waves, which looked like erupting geysers into which Eric  would plunge.  In retrospect it was probably stupid to go out,  even though we didn't drift much and paddling back wasn't bad.  What if there had been bad currents though?  But I can always say  that Eric was the one insisting upon going out and I just went  along to make sure he didn't get hurt. Never again though. </ul></blockquote>

The tide was coming in, and it got more and more difficult  to catch waves. In spite of that I probably caught my best wave  toward the end. One head-high wave came through. Everybody was  on the inside but for that guy I had never seen before. Unfortunately  he was clearly learning and afraid to drop into anything so in spite  of being in the _perfect_ spot he backed off.  <li> Overall not as good as it could have been (after so much wind everybody  expected huge waves), but still fun and probably among the best  choices this morning. </ul></blockquote>

About halfway through half of those guys paddled out to Paradise after a great set broke over there (a total fluke though)  <li> Waist-high is a couple of nice chest-high sets that surprised everybody. A tad windy, but not bad at all. Not super consistent but somewhat of a decent shape at times.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with a couple of fun ones.

There was that  guy out there who had never surfed before (how did he end up at Threes???) and he told us: "I am just hanging out here, catch whatever and I'll try to stay out of your way". We talked a bit, nice guy, who was driven out of Pops due to crowds.  <li> After catching about 5 waves at Threes we all paddled to the  inside of Paradise. It was more consistent there, but of course  super peaky and super shallow with sea urchins everywhere. Caught  about 10 waves there, with a few steep take-offs. Other people  started paddling out and we went in.  <li> Overall a pretty lame session with a few rides here and there, but  a nice afternoon. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Kammieland, 10AM-12PM  <li> on my 8'2''  <li> with Eric and Tracy, between 3 and 10 other people out  <li> Waist- to head-high, a bit choppy and windy, not very clean but fine, a few lulls. Overall pretty lame conditions for locals there, but pretty nice for me  <li> Caught 5-6 rides, with 2 decent rights with extremely fun  take-offs. It was a bit of a struggle with the 8'2'' after not  surfing it for so long, but I am happy I took that board out for my  first North Shore session. Definitely something else here, with the  great view of the shore, more powerful/steep waves (even on a small  day like today). Most notable was the constant current/wind, which  meant that I had to paddle the whole time to stay in place. Quite the  workout. And on each take-off I felt like I wasn't going to make it,  struggling to get into the wave and then feeling like I was going to  eat it right after making it into the wave. But turns out I made all  take-offs. I would have surfed better on my longboard I think, but  riding the 8'2'' was a blast.  <li> One of the local guys there, older, very few teeth was doing  head stand after head stand on shoulder-high waves. Very  impressive.  <li> Overall a great feeling to finally have made it to the North Shore,  and a clear realization of how insane it can be here when it's big.  Definitely going there when it's small for a long time, possibly  for ever. </ul></blockquote>

Most sets were at waist-high with higher peaks, and a few  bigger sets once in a while, in particular a beautiful head-high  one with everybody inside.  <li> Caught about 15 rides, with one great right toward the end. Chest-high  on the peak, very nice wall, and luckily I was the one sitting the  deepest so everybody backed off. Made the drop and then did many turns  all the way to the inside.  <li> Compared to the North Shore with my 8'2'', this was amazingly  easy surfing.  I felt like I had improved actually, but I was  still tired from yesterday's session.  <li> Beautiful morning too. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:30AM-8:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> with Eric. Nobody out.  <li> waist- to chest-high, sometimes walling up to be overhead on the  inside, semi-glassy, not very consistent with long lulls between sets.  <li> The plan to go to Flies to score some waves without dealing with the  crowd at Threes today worked perfectly. The waves weren't as nice as at  Threes as expected, but in fact they're a bit rawer an a little bit more  challenging, which makes it fun.  <li> The reef has a slightly raised part on the inside which causes a  section on the right to close out ahead of the pocket, which is  something that one has to negotiate somehow, whenever it's possible.  Today somehow, there were a few perfectly lined-up waves that connected  nicely to the inside with the bad section being short and easily  avoidable.  <li> I caught about 15 rides, or so, with 2 great rights that were in  the chest-high range and a bit bigger on the inside. Really  exhilarating, especially because this wave at Flies just feels  bigger than it really is (as noted by Eric).  <li> There were a few bigger sets, head-high peaks, but we were always  stuck inside.  <li> On a wave both Eric and I paddled. He was closer to the peak but  before the weird section, and for some reason I thought I'd paddle  and get on a high line, zipping through the section, thus putting  space in between us. Not sure why I went ahead with the plan, but  it was just a little bit too sketchy and I actually fell sort of in  front of him. No worries, but that was pretty lame...  <li> Eric pointed out a few land features to line up on, which is always  very useful.  <li> Overall, a great session in an empty spot that worked and delivered  good waves once in a while. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 8:30AM-10:15AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> by myself, between 2 and 10 other people out, with Eric and Tracy paddling out about halfway through the session.  <li> Glassy at the beginning, and a bit windy at the end. waist- to  head-high, with a few bigger sets. Clean and organized but many close  outs. Not super consistent, but a very good 1h between 9 and 10.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with three great ones, all rights.  <li> The first was was slightly overhead, with a super steep wall that was holding. The drop was easy, but then the wave walled up and I managed to stay close to the wall and zip through the section, hand in the water, with the beginning of a barrel forming (but not really, this being Flies and all). Short ride, about 20 yards, but  really intense.  <li> The second was on a wave that doubled up and was easily 2ft overhead. I made a sketchy drop and then surfed the wall straight on a super high line. I don't think I ever surfed such a high line on a wave this size before, and watching the bottom of the wave to far below my feet was quite something. This ended with a  big bottom turn at the end to kick out the board. Probably the wave of the day out there really. It was insane and I was oozing adrenaline after the ride. Tracy was on the inside and she said the wave was huge. I was really happy I had made it.  <li> The third wave was only shoulder high, but completely lined-up and I rode it all the way to the little jetty there, for a 100 yard ride. Today the channel was actually breaking for some reason, so the peaks were much closer to Diamond Head than usual. These three waves all occurred within the same 1/2 hour. I got very lucky I guess.  <li> Then the conditions completely crapped out pretty much from one minute to the next. No idea why. I paddled back in. Beautiful morning out there too with warm and turquoise water. </ul></blockquote>

What a difference a day makes.  <li> Met Eric in the parking lot. He decided not to paddle out because  his shoulder was sore and the conditions weren't worth it, which  they definitely weren't.  <li> I caught about 10 rides, all bumping and sort of lame. Didn't catch any  of the bigger waves because there wasn't anywhere to go really. At some  point I got stuck on the inside after surfing a left (surprise,  surprise) and it literally took my 20 minutes of constant  paddling to get back out. I ended the session on a pseudo-ride that  took me to the stairs.  <li> Talked a little bit to the other guy who was also out yesterday,  reflecting on how lame this was. We ended up surfing way over to  the Diamond Head side of the spot, basically at the spot called  Incinerators (I think). Very odd. </ul></blockquote>

Also made sort of a sketchy take-off on  an inside peak, which was pretty fun.  <li> There was a strong current taking us towards Diamond Head and  requiring constant paddling. Quite the work out.  <li> It was fun being in the line-up, talking to everybody, etc. Very  friendly atmosphere as usual. Eric was talking about his trip to Hilo  where he saw 50+ surfers at one of the spots with knee-high waves. So  I guess that we are lucky here in Waikiki! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 6:15AM-7:45AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> Paddled out with Mitch and Eric. Met Jim, and later Nathan and  Clarence in the line up. A couple of other people out, two older  guys I've seen before.  <li> Waist-high with a few chest-high waves, messy, choppy, pretty much  horrible, and windier as time went on.  <li> Somehow, it was still possible to catch waves and I caught about  15 rides. A couple were actually fun, especially a right  that doubled up and was head-high on the peak. A couple of longish  rights and lefts as well, but nothing like the normal Threes waves  at all. Bumpy rides, multiple peaks, etc.  The spot was pretty much unrecognizable due to the mixed-up  wind swells. Same strong current as yesterday.  <li> At the end of the session this guy I had seen on the beach before  paddled out. Baseball cap, sunglasses, wearing only shorts, and a  lit cigar! To top it off he was quite the "ostentatious knee  paddler", paddling over to the outside of the spot and staying on  his knees on his massive board (which from the distance looked  like a foamy, but I can't quite believe it was). He clearly  wanted attention and his whole attitude was very condescending,  paddling around like he was the rooster ruling the farm animals.  After not catching anything on the outside he paddled inside, sat  right next to me, and paddled for a lame small wave (not that I  hadn't been paddling for those all morning though). He rode it  and then fell on the inside, completely going under water and  sadly ruining his cigar. He paddled in then, either disgusted by  the conditions or embarrassed to have wet his cigar on his first  wave, or both.  Talked to Clarence about him. Clarence said his  name is Kim (I think) but that he calls him Punchy! One day  Clarence was by himself and Punchy paddled over and planted  himself 1ft from him, which really freaked him out. As far as  Clarence knows the guy's a photographer but paddles out  sometimes, and is sort of crazy and wants some attention. I have  to say that he provided amusement during this otherwise lame  session. It was particularly amusing because we all knew each  other in the line-up and he was sort of the freaky outsider. When  he first paddled over actually, Jim said with this disgusted look on  his face: "Who the fuck is that???" which totally encapsulated  what we were all thinking at that exact moment. </ul></blockquote>

Caught 20+ rides, with a couple of very fun rights. Kathy's board worked pretty well, especially with Dario's fin on it.  <li> It was hard adjusting to wearing a wetsuit as the paddling was so much harder. The water temp was a bit of a shock as well after so many sessions in Hawai`i, but it really wasn't too bad after a few minutes.  <li> It was great being out with Dario and Travis. Travis was surfing  his 5'8'' quad and he was on fire.  <li> 1 sea lion in the line-up, popping up super close to us for some  reason and was sort of freaking us out. At some point apparently it was following me as I was  paddling back out. Before that Dario said that it had jumped right  next to his board. Travis' theory is that it was attracted by the  smell of a powerbar I had brought to the line-up and whose wrapper  was stuck in my wetsuit. </ul></blockquote>

Nothing was happening  there, besides a single seal ion checking us out (the same one as  yesterday?). So after about 15 minutes we paddled back to 33s.  There were a few waves breaking there, and we caught a few. The  left was a bit sketchy as there were boils all over the water  surface due to the shallow bottom. We caught a few rights (Dario  had one that I'd say qualified as waist-high). After a while we  paddled back all the way to Chasm.  <li> Chasm was a bit better and I caught perhaps 10 rides. My first  wave was pathetic as I fell back due to exhaustion. This paddling  with a wetsuit on is just so much more work. But then I had a few  fun rights. Botched a sketchy take-off I should have made, made  it on a sketchier take-off.  <li> The highlight of the session were the dolphins. At some point we had  about 6 of them in front of us paddling out. As the wave stood up  they turned around and surfed towards us, barely below the  surface. Three of them were within 1ft of my board, going under it. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Cherry Hill, 7:00AM-9:30AM  <li> on Kathy's 8'6''  <li> with Dario and Travis  <li> Glassy, knee- to waist-high, not consistent, closing out often.  <li> It was very cold in the morning and as we were going down the cliff  there were very little waves to be seen. The water temperature  had dropped over the week to a supposed 56 degrees. It just  didn't look good or worth it. We walked down towards the pointe  and it looked to be a slightly better shape there but smaller.  The air was so cold it actually hurt my hands. We walked back,  and then, somehow Travis and Dario got pumped up to paddled out. I  just followed.  <li> The water wasn't as cold as we expected actually but still pretty  cold. We had a blast though, being totally goofy in the water.  And in the end we all caught a few fun waves though, which was  sort of surprising. I caught 3 decent rights, with a face for a few  maneuvers. T got a very good last wave, with a little floater to  cap it off.  <li> Dario went in a bit early, and T and I stayed out longer. This  guy paddled out to right where we were at the end, which was pretty  annoying given that the whole beach was empty.  <li> Overall a surprisingly fun session in spite of the bad conditions  and the cold.  <li> One duck in the line-up! That was very weird. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, New Break and Chasm, 11:30AM-1:30PM  <li> on Kathy's 8'6''  <li> with Dario, nobody out at New Break, 3 guys on the outside a  Chasm at the end of the session.  <li> Glassy, knee-high, not consistent.  <li> We really paddled out for the sake of getting wet on a beautiful sunny  day. First went to New Break because there were about 4-5 people out  at Ab. Caught a few waves there, knee-high trying to get to  waist-high. We then paddled to Chasm because it looked better.  Once at Chasm, the outside just wasn't breaking at all. So we  were sort of on our way in when we realized that the inside was  breaking, with fun waist-high+ peaks an a little wave all the way  to the evil ledge. So we surfed that for a while. I had a take  off super close to the ledge and had to bail because I was  getting in 2 feet of water. Later Dario caught that wave and  basically got all the way to the ledge. He had to somersault  backward and his board went over the ledge (he had no leash)!  That could've been pretty bad. I paddled back to the outside twice,  but although we could definitely see that the swell was filling in,  not much was going on. We ended the session pretty exhausted. I must  have caught about 15 waves. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 6:30AM-9:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> with Scott, Yves, and Olivia. Met Ron, Jim and his friend JJ, Doug and his two girls. Initially the three old guys from Pops were out as well. 10 people out at most.  <li> Super glassy, ankle- to waist-high, not very consistent but "sets" coming through. Probably one of the most gorgeous mornings out there.  <li> During the first part of the session I caught about 20 rides,  with a couple of very fun waist+ right handers. Surprisingly fun. It  was so great to be in warm water with no wetsuit. My paddling was  so incredibly strong without the fighting against the wetsuit. I  paddled for  waves I didn't really think I could catch and all of  a sudden found myself standing. It was Scott's first time at Threes  and in spite of the tiny conditions he was very impressed.  <li> At about 7:40 I paddled back in to meet Yves and Olivia, his  13-year old daughter, for their first surfing session ever. We  rented boards and paddled out to Threes (Pops wasn't breaking).  After about 30 yards I started towing Olivia. After about 50 more  yards Yves grabbed Olivia's leash and I towed both of them to the  spot. Quite the workout.  After giving them some directions I  started looking for waves to push Olivia into. We did that on two  knee-high waves. On the first one she pearled, on the second one  she rode the white on her stomach all the way in and was quite  pleased. On her way out the most amazing thing happened. She  paddled right next to me (I have to say that she was very good at  sticking to being close to me...  she would totally pick up this  surfing thing after 10 sessions I think) and we saw beautiful  fish swim right under our boards in amazingly clear water. As we  raised our eyes to look for incoming waves we saw two whales that  were about 25 yards away, rolling on their sides and stretching  their side fins, showing us their tails, singing. The water was  completely still, and the 10 of us out there were completely  mesmerized. That was a totally magical, silent moment and Olivia was  completely flipping out. After that we were on the inside and a small outside  set came with people taking off left and right. I grabbed her board  and paddled with one arm trying to get out of the way. That worked  really well and as she was facing towards the beach and I was  basically pulling her to the outside she got to see people taking  off right next to her several times, which was pretty cool (those people  probably where wondering what the hell we were doing at Threes  though). I am just glad I did that otherwise she would have been  completely in the way. Finally I pushed her into a wave on which  she stood up a little before falling off, which made her day.  Towed her back in for most of the way to end a pretty amazing  first surf session for her and a great work out for me. While  "teaching" her I caught 3 absolutely perfect knee-high right  handers, in water so clear it felt like it was in 1 inch deep. </ul></blockquote>

The swell is still filling in and today was definitely a letdown compared to everybody's expectations.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with a couple of good rights. I sort of  missed the wave of the day though as I thought that other guy was  definitely paddling for it closer to the inside but he sort of  bailed at the end. For some reason I wasn't paddling for it at all  and my "turn and burn" at that point was just too little to late.  <li> Craig and I talked about the 3 guys from yesterday, a father and his  two sons as it turns out. Basically, as the sons couldn't get  waves yesterday (due to crappy conditions and to the fact that we  didn't let them get too many I guess, although I can't recall  taking waves from them myself), the father started to play what  Craig called "team surfing". Basically he would not even try to  surf but just paddle around trying to block other people who might  try to paddle for the same wave as his sons! Craig was blocked  twice in this way and couldn't believe it. It happened to  Clarence too a first time, and then on the second time Clarence  just paddled right over the guy's board. That pretty much ended  it. Part of me wishes I had been there to see that, part of me  is happy that I missed it. </ul></blockquote>

Alone for about 1/2 hour, then 2 people out.  <li> waist- to head-high, junky and bumpy, not very consistent,  breaking a little bit all over the place, a it choppy, lots of  doubles, etc.  <li> I only had 1 hour to surf this morning because I was supposed to  take Norm to the hospital at 8AM. So I opted for Flies because it  was close and since there was a swell it should show some waves.  Turns out it wasn't really a good choice as it was pretty much  a mess, and to make it worse I took my 8'2'' out. It would have  been much better with my 9'2'' to make it down bumpy lumpy waves.  <li> I got there so early that Kakahako Park was closed and I had to wait for them to open it up at 5:30AM. I pretty paddled out in the dark. Sort of eerie, cool, and perhaps a bit stupid.  <li> I essentially caught 2 waves. The first one was a head-high, I made  the drop after much bumping up and down and rode it for a little  bit before it closed out. The second was the last wave of the session,  a small waist-high left that took me close to the rocks.  <li> On an aborted left I got caught inside for about 20 minutes, which  was a huge workout but sort of fun actually. Somehow Flies seems  to have these periods of outside close outs on big sets that keeps  you stuck inside for a while while you make your long way around  back to the channel. </ul></blockquote>

Doug had a better story though. A dead guy was found in Waikiki two days ago, drowned and weighted down (either suicide or crossed the mob).

I dropped in on this chest-high wave to the left of the peak and zipped through back to the right. There were two guys there who thought better than dropping in. It was just a perfect wave, very high line, in the perfect spot in the pocket. Nice off-the-lip turn towards the end. I kicked out close to Doug who was sitting on his board and taking pictures. He said that my ride was great but that I was too far for him to take a picture. Too bad because that one must have looked good.  <li> After that I pretty much waited for a last wave in. A couple of chest-high sets came again but I was never in the right spot and the left was closing out.

This guy was deeper than I was but he was a beginner and had been going straight to the beach all morning. So I dropped in (and yes, he went straight and fell), and locked in a high line. That wave had a surprising amount of juice.

It just felt like the board  simply did a 180 in place. Pretty funny. Clarence laughed his ass  off as he was paddling over the wave while that happened. After that  incident I was much more in control of the board.  <li> My next to last wave was actually a somewhat scary inside  right, with a super intense head-high drop and a surprising amount  of juice. Super short ride, basically a drop and hold on for dear life  on the first section.  <li> My last wave was an in-between wave which the outside  longboarding patrollers couldn't go for, but that was not  breaking in the typical inside place. I paddled like crazy and  made the shoulder-high drop pretty deep. Some shortboarder backed  off as I was deeper and he hooted while I was dropping.

I was  partially submerged in white water at times just to make it out  again and again.  Although it was only 7:15AM at that point I was  getting tired and decided to end on a high note.  <li> Great morning out there, great vibe in the water with a lot of  hooting and laughing. Absolutely wonderful way to start the day.  I felt really good on the 8'2''. That board was basically perfect  for these conditions I think. </ul></blockquote>

About 20 other people out, including Doug, Clarence, Ron later, Steve, etc. WAY too many people for the number of waves.  <li> waist- to chest-high, with only rare chest-high sets. Glassy but not very clean most of the time. Very occasional beautiful sets.  <li> Caught about 10 rides, including a nice chest-high left and a nice chest-high right, and all the others on rather weak waves.  <li> There was a swell forecast and I guess people just showed  up. It was quite crazy to see the spot that crowded on such lame conditions. I still managed to get quite a few waves, but tomorrow I'll probably go to Flies.  <li> On one of the best waves of the day Clarence was doing a super  critical take-off (rail grabbing, pseudo-vertical) when that total  kook dropped in on him about 3ft from him. They both went down  crashing. Clarence told him off (with Aloha though) but it was such  a painful thing to see. I got dropped in on a left by that girl  (who yelled "Sorry" as she tumbled though), but it was a  semi-closeout, so it wasn't a big deal.  <li> I paddled back in kind of early and when I got to the shower  there were two workers from the Hale Koa fixing one of the showers  (no clue why the Hale Koa guys are fixing what I thought was a  public shower, but whatever). They were hilarious. We talked a bit  and they were full-on local. And then they started making fun on  tourists walking by: "Hey Brah, see dat guy, plaid shirt, shorts,  sandals with socks pulled up to the knee... I don't care if I am old,  brah, if I dress like dat on vacation I shit myself". And so on.  It was great. It brought me back to afternoons back  home with my cousin, who owned a snack bar on the beach, spent  his entire day making fun of tourists. There is something pathetic  but so necessary about making fun of the tourists that provide  your livelihood. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:30AM-8:30AM  <li> on my 9'2'', no leash.  <li> By myself. Alone in the line-up for about 40 minutes, then 7 other people out including Jim (the "other" Jim) and Eric. 3 military guys who had no clue what they were doing at all, which was pretty annoying.  <li> waist- to chest-high, with a few head-high+ sets. A bit choppy  but fine, typical Flies waves. Somewhat consistent.  <li> When I checked it before going out it seemed only waist-high and nobody  was out. I knew the swell was supposed to back down so I had opted  for my 9'2'' in the morning after whimsically considering taking my 7'6'' out. So  I went out without a leash, which is always good practice. Waves  kept getting bigger and people were coming out, so towards the end  of the session I sort of wished I had a leash, but all in all I  lost my board only twice, right at the end of rides in crazy  white water, never on the take-off, so it was all good.  <li> Caught about 20 rides, with quite a few fun rights, although  not completely lined up. I chickened out of a sketchy take-off  on a head-high wave because everybody was inside and I was about 50%  sure of losing my board on that one and thus 10% sure of beheading somebody..  <li> I probably rode the biggest ridden wave of the day. I was  somewhat on the outside and this set came. I caught  the first wave,  which was a couple feet overhead (Eric said "that thing was huge" after the fact). It was probably among of the 10 sketchiest take-offs I ever  did, but this one was without a leash! I barely made it down the face  and sort of free fell into it. But somehow I made it. The wave sort of  closed out though, but I rode it to the inside where it reformed.  With quite a bit of adrenaline I think that every fiber of my body  was just focused on not losing the board. The next two waves in  the set were smaller, but actually nicer, and Eric got a pretty  nice ride.  <li> Nice conversations in the line-up with Jim and Eric, but mostly  about sharks! Get this. Four days ago Eric was at Flies and everybody  got out because a shark was swimming on the outside. Yesterday Jim  was out and when he paddled out people in the line-up told him  that a shark had just swam through the line-up, but somehow they  stayed out and weren't too fazed by it. Two weeks ago, a friend  of Jim had a shark come up to him and, he said, "look at him",  while he was by himself sitting in the line-up, which caused him  to paddle back in immediately. All this at Flies. And to think I  was by myself out there, for 40 minutes, with no leash, at  6:30AM, under overcast skies... Eric was like "I guess you just  have guts". He was sort of joking because there has never been an  attack and people are kind of a bit blase about the whole thing.  But still. I found it mostly amusing actually, until my new  nickname becomes "stumpy" I guess. </ul></blockquote>

Nobody out for the whole session.  <li> knee- to waist-high+, a bit choppy, not very clean and/or consistent.  <li> I drove all the way from Waimanalo this morning and opted to go to  Flies because a swell is supposedly coming and parking in Waikiki  for a late session is never easy. After checking the spot it  seemed clear that my 9'2'' would have been a better choice for the  conditions though, but I was too lazy to go home and switch board.  <li> The first 1/2 hour of the session was sort of sad, with knee- to  waist-high waves. I have a really hard time surfing well on  this board on small waves.  <li> After this, there were much bigger sets coming and I caught  one very nice shoulder-high right and a couple of almost chest-high  really lined up waves. It's pretty amazing how as soon as waves  get bigger all of a sudden I surf this board so much better, with  my feet in the right place and a decent flow. The board is so  fast that a couple time I was a little bit off balance leaning  backward during the accelerations.  <li> At some point, this freak set came. I was inside after surfing a  rather lame left, and I paddled out when I saw these shadows on  the horizon. I barely made it past the first one, then scrambled  like mad to make it past the second one (we're talking only  chest-high at that point), and so on. It was an 8-wave set, and  each wave was a little bit bigger than the previous one. On the next to last I actually  had to turtle, but I got back on super fast and barely punched  through the lip of the last wave, which was a little bit  overhead. It wasn't a big deal of course, but it just sort of  gave me an appreciation for nightmare scenarios like this on the  North shore with waves twice as big or more, more wing, more  current.  <li> Toward the end things slowed down and I caught a couple of waist-high  waves, with the second one taking me to the jetty to conclude the session.  <li> I caught about 15 rides total. At the top of the hill I met Tracy who  was checking the conditions. All in all a surprisingly fun session  in spite of a dismal beginning. And nobody out. What are the odds  of surfing a lined-up shoulder-high wave in Town under a beautiful  weather with the closest surfed around about 800 yards away? </ul></blockquote>

There is a swell coming (when isn't there?) and people were sort of  hoping for a little bump today. Tomorrow's supposed to be big.  <li> I caught about 20 waves, with many tiny weak ones on the inside,  and a few fun waist-high rights. Luckily I was in perfect  position when what was probably the best wave of the day came in,  in a 2-wave set. I caught the first wave, super smooth take-off,  and then pumping up and down the line for about 30 yards before I  had to kick the board out before a close-out section. If that  wave had been lined up all the way to the inside it would have  ranked among the best waves I ever rode at Threes. I could tell  people were sort of jealous out there after that ride. Ron got  the second wave of the set but that one was a tad bigger and more  of a close-out.  <li> I feel that I surfed pretty well today.

My last  was was pretty decent, almost a chest-high drop. On one of my best waves one of the two girls,  who was clearly a beginner, dropped in on me and did "the works": on all fours on the board,  tip over, board goes flying by my head. I had to do a major cutback and of course found myself  in the white. That was pretty lame. I almost said something later on, but she was so oblivious  and it was really her friend's role (who could surf decently) to tell her about these things.  Whatever.  <li> Today was actually a great day for me because I really felt comfortable on the 8'2''. All my take-offs  were good, my feet were always in the right spot.

Definitely harder to  ride this board well in choppy conditions, but I did ok. I had one  left that was decent actually.  <li> Although SUPs are annoying, I have to say that today I saw for the  best SUP rider I have ever seen. The guy was completely amazing,  nose riding, 360, hitting the lip, doing all types of juggling  with his paddle while riding, tail slides, absolutely unreal. It  was quite something to watch. He had this way of turning by sinking  the tail and pivoting with so much control he could do fast  "turn-and-burns". He was by far the best wave rider out there.  <li> Update: 2 weeks after this session I found out that this SUP rider  was Leleo Kinimaka, a pretty well-known local rider who won several  contests, including one at Flies recently.  <li> 2 monk seals on the inside.

It was really  difficult to drop in on the wave due to the bumps, so definitely  a huge workout. I surfed pretty well considering the conditions  I think.  <li> Some of the people out there really sucked, which was a bit odd. At the  end there was a guy with his kid on his board.  <li> Beautiful sunset. Toward the end of the session I started thinking a little  bit about all the shark sighting, about the dimming light, and about that  school of fish that kept jumping out of the water all around the line-up.

In particular, I caught what ended up being the wave of the day, an almost chest-high right that had a perfect shape. I was able to pump up and down the face and end by actually hitting the lip before a close-out section. Really nice, as Eric commented later. I totally lost my focus after that ride, and sort of goofed on other waves later. It was such a mellow session with great conversations in the line-up.  <li> Jim told us about an incident that happened to him at Threes last week  on Thursday, which was a big day (couple feet overhead and more on  some sets). He took off on a wave and was racing down the line when  he saw that local older guy on an 11ft board about to drop in on  him. He yelled at him to not drop in, but the guy did anyway, and  at that point he was only a few feet ahead of Jim. So Jim had to  straighten up to the beach, at which point he realized there was a  guy on the inside who had just wiped out on the previous wave. He  was going for the guys head and barely avoid it, sticking his skegs  into the guys board instead. After checking that that guy was ok, he  paddled back to the local guy and basically told him that he just  couldn't do things like this, and that he nearly caused a really  bad accident. The local guy just dismissed the whole thing with "I  didn't see you". When Jim called his bullshit, the other guy  started talking down to him, telling him that he's "home", and that  Jim should get a license to surf here, etc. The stereotypical  local-haole thing, which I've actually not really seen before. The day  after, the guy was still there, and he started talking shit about  Jim to other people in the line-up, but since everyone knows Jim  they all sort of told the guy that if Jim yelled at him that's  because he had done something wrong, etc. At any rate, Jim was  quite rattled by the experience, especially because he said it's  the first time in his life he's run somebody over like that.

Doug on his SUP at both spots on and off, catching pretty decent waves.  <li> Waist- to shoulder-high, head-high on the peak, reasonably smooth and consistent.  <li> Started off at Threes, which was odd. The pseudo swell wasn't really hitting it right. Caught 3-4 waves, with one decent one, but the wave was nothing like what it typically is. I followed Mitch who had paddled over to Paradise pretty much as soon as I got to Threes.  <li> Paradise was sort of typical but also sort of atypical. What was typical was that it was really hard to read the waves. Some loomed really big on the outside and dissolved to nothing right before getting to the line-up. Some looked like nothing and then generated head-high peaks right in front of us. It was consistent in that waves were rolling through almost continuously, but only a few were breaking. Also typical was the fact that the take-off had to be on the peak and not on the shoulder. But very atypical was the fact that there was a nice wall! Paradise is known as a peak and nothing much after a nice drop. Well, today rides were long. The wall wasn't comparable to nice Threes, but it was pretty nice nonetheless. It just required a little bit of stalling along the way to not get to ahead of oneself.  <li> I caught about 10 waves, including 2 very nice rights with head-high drops and long shoulder-high walls that kept reforming.  <li> A lot of laughs in the water with Clarence yelling like a mad mad "outside!!", "go left!!!", etc. Three of us. Sizeable waves. Beautiful sunrise. Can't ask for much more for my last session before I take off for more than a month. </ul></blockquote>

Pretty typical.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 3-4 on decently sized waves with  above waist-high drops and a bit of a wall. All in all a mellow  nice session to get back into things. Still not in very good surfing  physical shape, but getting better. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Sunset Cliffs, Sub, 7:30AM-8:30AM  <li> on Dario's 9'  <li> With Dario. 4-5 other people out.  <li> knee-high with a few waist-high waves. Glassy, very weak.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with nothing special at all. Pretty  hard to get into waves.  <li> The highlight of the session was my trying Dario's new 6'8''  Shro's egg. I actually caught two waves and one of them was halfway  decent in spite of these weak wave conditions. Sort of thinking  this shortboarding thing should perhaps happen. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Mission Beach, 4PM-5PM  <li> on my new 9'6'' noserider, which I bought from Jeff today, no leash.  <li> With Dario. 10 other people out, spongers and swimmers on the  inside.  <li> waist-high, getting a tad hollow as the tide dropped.  <li> We paddled out for the hell of it to get a little bit of water  time before driving up to Ocean side for the screening of  Super Sessions. Foolishly we went without leashes, sort of  forgetting about the crowd factor, about all the kids on the  inside, and about the dropping tide. This resulted in a super  intense session with 100% of the focus on not losing the board.  Also not a great idea when riding a new board for the first time.  <li> Caught about 5-6 rides, with a few fun ones actually. Eventually  we paddled back in because this session was just too stressful. Losing  one's board (and riding longboards in the increasingly hollow sessions  was just getting more and more challenging) meant 99% chance of  hitting someone, most likely some old lady or a toddler on the  inside. (Who have no business being there, on the wrong side of  the flag in the first place.)  <li> Overall Jeff's board will be great for small or crowded days at  Threes. I am hoping that it will serve as a "guest" board and  also as a way to practice and improve my almost-non-existing  noseriding abilities. I am writing this report in the plane back  to Hawai`i and it remains to be seen how the board will survive  the trip back. Dario helped with the packing, putting plastic bottles  around the glassed-in side fins, and we used tons of bubble wrap.  We'll see. </ul></blockquote>

Met Jim, Guy, and Ann at Threes, and then Eric, Clarence at Paradise. 5-6 other people out at Paradise.  <li> waist- to sometimes chest-high, pretty smooth, but slow and weak  due to the high tide.  <li> Started off at Threes. Waves had a very nice shape and were  coming in somewhat regularly, but after the take off rides would be  rather slow and waves would stop breaking prematurely. Still, it  was nice to see such beautiful lines. After catching about 10 waves,  we all paddled out to Paradise.  <li> Paradise was breaking a bit all over the place, many fake waves,  occasional bigger waves breaking on the outside. Some waves had  a wall, but otherwise it was pretty typical. Caught 4-5 waves,  some on the inside, and paddled back in.  <li> Great full rainbow halfway through the session. Nice conversations  in the water. </ul></blockquote>

Then Eric showed up and we followed to Paradise where there were 4-5 other people out.  <li> knee-high, glassy, not consistent and weak.  <li> After everybody expecting better conditions than yesterday, they were actually worse. Caught about 3-4 waves at Threes, and then about 10 at Paradise, but nothing exciting at all with very weak rides. Waves were better at Paradise, but from there we saw probably the best wave of the day breaking at Threes. A few good ones breaking at Pops too, occasionally, but owned by the older crew on their massive tankers.  <li> A shortboarder paddled out to Paradise and was actually  catching some inside waves.  At some point he made some weird noise  and then started cursing in French and yelling "help". I paddled  over. Apparently something was pulling on his leash and he got  really freaked out. Conversing in French I told him that perhaps  it was the coral, but he was adamant it wasn't. Probably a sea turtle  getting snagged on the leash or something. Anyway, it was quite odd  and he just couldn't get over the fact that he was right next to  a fellow countryman.  <li> Paddled back in with Eric after catching a lame left. Beautiful  morning, and perhaps a swell tomorrow. </ul></blockquote>

Finally the other Jim at the end.  <li> waist- to chest-high with a few shoulder-high peaks, glassy, typical  Flies with the wave never quite lined up all the way to the inside, not super consistent but very nice waves coming through.  <li> Caught about 25 waves, with several very fun ones. I was doing ok  on my 8'2'' actually. Sort of need to get back into it as this board  is so much faster. But the take-offs were good, and I did a few nice turns.  <li> One a chest-high wave I rode the section really well I thought  and at the end of it I went over the back, since the second section  was (as usual) closing out in front of me. I didn't have quite  enough speed and although my body went up in the air off the back  the board was sort of behind on the wave. Eric was next to me and  basically told me that the next time he sees me not conclude such a  great ride by hitting the close out white water to snap a turn  he'll send me back to shore. That was hilarious. And he totally  have a good point. I should totally end the ride with a snap off  the white water and try to see if I can make it, rather than just  bailing off the back each time.  <li> I had a couple of pseudo-sketchy take-offs on shoulder-high peaks,  but made them all surprisingly. I really love this board.  <li> Quite exhausted at the end of this long session on this board. I can  sense that this is not going to be a productive day.  <li> Overall a great session with essentially nobody out, very nice  conditions, calm winds, and beautiful sunrise. The "nobody out"  part was almost baffling. </ul></blockquote>

Eric showed up after a while. 1 other person out.  <li> waist-high with a few shoulder-high or higher peaks, glassy,  cleaner than yesterday, but less consistent.  <li> Caught about 20 waves, with a few nice waist-high ones lined up  perfectly, a few chest-high ones that were also lined up with  a very nice wall that held or with very makable sections, and  a couple of take-offs on more rare head-high waves that sort of closed  out after 10 yards or so.  <li> I realized that on this board I have a hard time taking off on the  lefts. Today I had to readjust my feet quite a bit on the take  offs to, unlike yesterday. Not sure why.  <li> It's amazing how spoiled we are. Eric and I were talking a lot in  the line-up, and because  it was less consistent than yesterday and seemed to have a little less  size, at least during the first half of the session, we were saying  that we should just go back in early. 5 minutes later Eric  caught a fantastic head-high waves that was clearly the wave of  the day as it held all the way in. I myself caught a chest-high  wave right after that that also held and that allowed me many  maneuvers.... Right.... Let's go back in because it's such a lame  session and according to Eric's terminology it's not "Classic Flies".  And to think he started surfing on the East Coast where people would  kill for a session like this. But yeah, overall it wasn't as  nice as yesterday and as Eric said "more crowded" (yesterday was only us, today  there was somebody else who was surfing another peak actually and  going only left because goofy footed...the nerve!).  I feel like we're losing touch with reality  a bit here, especially thinking that we're in Town during the summer,  a 5 minute drive from where I live and essentially alone out there.  <li> Picked up my 9'6'' and I'll take it out tomorrow most  likely. The Ding repair job was superb. </ul></blockquote>

Met Larry in the line-up. between 3 and 6 other people out, including two older kneeboarders and one SUPer.  <li> waist- to head-high waves, glassy, not super consistent but really nice waves coming through if a bit fat and slow.  <li> That's right, a session on the 7'6'', for no good reason. It was sort of a struggle in terms of paddling, especially that one time when I stubbornly decided to paddle back to the line-up from the left after surfing a head-high left all the way in. But a great workout. In terms of take-offs, basically each time I was already in a good position it was fine, but when I had to struggle to get into the wave or when I had to take off at a steep angle it was no good, taking off with feet off the board at one time!  <li> Caught about 15 waves, including 1 screaming overhead right, 1 great overhead left, and a couple of head-high rights. These were great rides, but I didn't surf the board even close to its potential. I know it's capable of going much much faster and my maneuvers were sort of timid when they could have been much more radical. Still, it was great to take off on these waves. Early on in the session though I totally botched a critical take-off, and I fell down a head-high face with the board sort of in between my legs. My back foot basically slipped off to the side of the board. That was pretty lame.  <li> Overall a great session and a huge workout with a lot of paddling. </ul></blockquote>

Somehow, during the beginning of the session, the 3 guys out were a bit inside and a bit down the line from peak on the right. So I positioned myself further out, and I scored 2 amazing head-high rights. Such beautiful shape that I thought Flies was channeling the spirit of Threes. Easy take-off, and then head-high wall for about 30 yards, followed by sections all the way to the inside. Really exhilarating and after both rides my teeth were actually chattering due to adrenaline I guess. Everybody in the line-up was like "fantastic wave man!" and I was repositioning myself in my spot, with them staying further down the line. Very odd.  <li> Toward the end it became crowded an the tide got higher leading to softer and slower waves, so I just paddled back in on a knee-high insider. There were actually about 5 beginners surfing the inside, which I had never seen before. </ul></blockquote>

Getting better as the tide started to drop.  <li> Caught about 15 waves. Several waist-high insiders that were fun with a decent wall. Nothing too fantastic, but it felt good on my 8'2''.  <li> I was in position for only a couple of the bigger waves. On the first one I made the drop but didn't keep a high enough line, so at the bottom of the bottom turn I had lost too much speed and the head high wall in front of me closed out. I could perhaps have made that section. On the second one, which was sort of a gnarly close out, I fell backward at the start of the bottom turn, not being used to the speed generated by that board.  <li> Beautiful glassy morning, but the tide really messed it up. My surfing on the 8'2'' wasn't great. Tomorrow, with even a higher tide, I'll probably take out my 9'6'' or my 9'2'' out. </ul></blockquote>

A bit slow, but definitely some size with several slightly overhead peaks. The waves were mostly clean, but with the usual two peaks, making it hard to take of deep and make it to the inside section.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with 3-4 really fun head-high rights. A few more mellow inside waves too, all rights.  <li> I fell on a somewhat critical take-off on a weird twisted head-high wave, but other than that surfing this board was easy. Kind of like surfing a barge at times, but pretty responsive (I put the fin pretty far forward too).  <li> Beautiful sunset with rainbows. Really nice way to end the day. </ul></blockquote>

On one of them I really had a wonderful ride, with a  great bottom turn and then coming back up super close to the lip  on a very high line, and then zipping across the face barely  making it to the next section. Some guy who was paddling back out  saw the whole ride and was going on about it afterwards.  <li> Overall an odd session, with some great waves coming through but  with very long lulls.

I felt really low on energy  out there though, after really overdoing it last week.  <li> At some point I passed up on two shoulder-high waves. I was sort of  outside, but just felt too tired to struggle to catch them. Besides,  everybody else on the inside was already paddling. Turns out nobody  caught them because they were just too fat and slow. Finding myself  alone in the line-up, this freak head-high single wave just  materialized itself right in front of me out of nowhere. I dropped  in and had a great ride on a steep wall that held about halfway  to the inside.

Although there were no waves for 1h, I paddled out when I started seeing some coming in, and they were on for about 1/2 hour, so it was well-timed. Caught about 10 rides, with 2-3 fun rights that were a bit higher than waist-high and that connected almost all the way to the inside.  <li> Nice conversation in the water with John about surfing in SD  county.

But it was so insanely glassy and beautiful  this morning that the whole session was sort of a zen meditative  experience. Too bad I felt queasy because I slept very poorly last  night. The 9'6'' was _so_ the right choice of board this morning.  <li> At some point, a darker line appeared on the horizon and as I  paddled out this solid waist-high wave rose in front of me. I  dropped in and it was just nice and completely lined-up, allowing  many turns. Definitely the wave of the day, although last week that  would have been a wave I wouldn't even have paddled for.  <li> The shortboarder on the inside, perhaps 40-something, was  completely amazing. Really stylish even in these crappy inside  waves. On one take-off he actually got covered briefly, and his  turns were just beautiful. Watching him surf in real waves would be  quite something. This is really what separates great surfers from  the rest, the ability to look great and effortless even in lame  conditions. For instance, I tried some cross-stepping today, but the  waves were just a bit too weak and I had a hard time. He, on the  other hand, started riding waves backwards on the board, switching  stance, all that on crappy insiders, taking off in the white water. </ul></blockquote>

I had one screaming take-off  on a peak that was easily 1ft overhead, but I had no place to go  so after the drop and a 10-yard ride I had to bail.  <li> All-in-all not an unpleasant session, but quite anti-climactic  compared to expectations. I've been surfing longer boards lately,  so some of my take-offs on my 8'2'' were a bit shaky, getting  better and better toward the end of the session. In particular, that  take-off on that bigger wave was actually nice and smooth. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:30AM-8AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself, 2-3 other people out at first, and up to 10 at the end, including Carl, and Justin and Garry at the end.  <li> chest-high drops and waist-high walls most of the time, but  infrequent head-high sets coming in, long lulls at times, high tide  and so a bit fat and slow, glassy.  <li> Great choice to take a longboard and surf the high tide conditions  given how it was clear that crowds were showing up for the lower  tides.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, including many pretty fun take-offs. Not many  lined up well, but at least the inside reform was very makable  and allowed a safe return to the channel.  <li> Took off on a couple of bigger head-high waves, which was nice. My  best ride was probably on a lined-up waist-high wave that I rode all the way to the rocks.  <li> I was showering after the session and looking at the line-up when  that 2-feet overhead outside broke, with everybody in the impact  zone. On the next set, that older kneeboarder guy dropped in  pretty outrageously on a shortboarder on the inside. They almost  collided, then hit the soup, and the kneeboard flew up in the  shortboarder's face. He was able to block it with his arms but it  was pretty horrid. </ul></blockquote>

Eric caught the wave of the day, a perfect right,  overhead, peeling perfectly all the way to the channel. He ended up  basically at the stairs.  <li> I ate it on a couple of late take-offs on head-high peaks mostly  due to my board being blown off the wave by the howling winds toward the end of the session.  <li> I was super tired and stressed out by all the house buying  insanity, all the excitement at work with my visitor from France,  and all the hospital visits. So it was great to get wet finally, but  my thoughts were a bit elsewhere for the whole session. My last wave  was very good, with a nice wall and makable sections.

I dropped in very late on a semi-close-out, which in retrospect wasn't the best way to get back in surfing after being sick for a while. Ate it. That was by far the best set of the session, which was sort of too bad. Then I caught 3 waist-high waves that were actually sort of decent. But longs were lasting forever, and everybody expected a repeat of that first set. But it never came.  <li> At the end I was joking with Molokai that we'd have to paddle in, and he looked at me like I was insane: "Paddle in??? NO WAY!". Eventually I caught a nice insider that I rode all the way in. Almost didn't make it as I was arching on the board forever before I could actually get up.

It was good to surf my  8'2'' and experience the difference with the long(er) boards. I  also tried Larry's 8' board which paddles really well and is more  of an egg-like thing. Very different from my 8'2'' which felt  like a short board by comparison.  <li> Some of my take-offs on my 8'2'' were really good, and some were really lame.

Had the tide  been a tad lower they would really have been great in spite of  being only in the waist-high range.  <li> Although at first it seems like it was going to be knee-high at  best, after Jim paddled in, every 15 minutes a nice waist-high set  would come through.  <li> These two SUPers paddled out, one very loud haole guy but very  good, teaching that other local-looking guy. They didn't really  take any waves, but the super loud teaching got for of annoying. Still  a pretty good vibe out there.  <li> I felt a tad bad because I cherry picked all the best waves. The other Jim is quite old and was never in position on the outside, and that Japanese tourist on his potato chip was just not at the right spot, especially given the tide. So I basically sat on the outside and caught the best waves. Oh well.  <li> I did one nice noseride.  <li> Overall a pretty nice session with a great vibe and little  perfect waves once in a while.

This  and the high tide made for a session at the beginning of which I though I would perhaps not catch a single wave on this board.  <li> In the end I caught about 10 waves, with nothing really good, but  at least I was far from shut out. As usual, some of my take-offs were  good, and some really sucked.  <li> It was a gorgeous sunny morning, and for the first time I was  wearing a hat, which I bought last night. Sort of dorky, but  it felt really comfortable and I think I'm sold on that idea. Now,  on a couple of take-offs the hat sort of hindered my vision and on  one of them I fell clearly because of the hat. So it's going to  take some getting used to. But it's worth it given how killer the  sun is even early in the morning.

When I showed up in the morning I saw surfers leaving the parking lot in droves, which wasn't a good sign. I went to check it and it looked inconsistent but I saw one rideable set and I figured that I'd be almost alone so it was worth it.  <li> As I paddled out a nice chest-high set showed up.

 <li> Flies, 6:45AM-8AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself. Nobody out. Eric was there but didn't dare paddle out and some other guy apparently was there but didn't make it to the line-up!  <li> Waist-high to a couple feet overhead, all over the place and messy, but no wind this early in the morning.  <li> I showed up and saw Eric's car but no sign of him. I paddled out figuring out it'd be a good workout.  <li> The conditions were so strange all over (amazingly there were overhead waves closing out over the entire area from Kewalo to Point Panic, even in the channel!), that the paddling out route was completely changed. You had to go around the spot close to the harbor and then paddle all the way back to the line-up. It took about 15 minutes to get out, which wasn't so bad.  <li> I caught a left immediately, and paddled back out. It was a bit sketchy, but I felt fine. I caught a right that was a major close-out and made it almost back to the jetty. I saw Eric at the top of the stairs and got out of the water to talk to him. Basically he didn't want to face the paddle out and the sketchy conditions out there, and after talking to him for 5 minutes I paddled back out.  <li> This last paddle out was quite something, I'd say more than 20 minutes, but nothing too horrible I guess. It just felt like I was out in the middle of the ocean.  After paddling all the way from from the harbor mouth almost (I don't think I ever paddled that far West at Flies, I actually had trouble getting my bearings using the landmarks on the shore for 1 second) I attempted two sketchy take-offs on two overhead waves. On the first one I ate it due to some horrible step in the wave that sent me flying up in the air. I went down and deep, but luckily emerged pretty much where I had been as opposed to in the impact zone. On the second take-off, which was on a bigger wave (clearly 2ft overhead, but perhaps more), I _almost_ made it, but after zipping down the face for 10 yards the wave completely close-out on me and I had to dive off the board. I went super deep and both my feet got entangled in the leash. I had to dolphin kick my way back up and was fine, but all of a sudden very drained.  <li> At that point, I decided to call it quit and I caught a smaller  shoulder-high wave all the way in. This is where I saw those two guys on top of the stairs. One  of them had tried to paddled out at Point Panic, but a clean-up set  basically picked him up and carried him 50 yards into the rocks, where his  board was dinged. He had to climb up the rocks with his board, which can't  have been fun, and came to Flies to check out on his buddy. His buddy,  according to Eric, tried to make it out to the line-up at Flies, but just  had to give up after 20 minutes of efforts. I was outside the whole time but I never saw him. All of a sudden I felt pretty good about paddling out 3 times in a row and catching 3 waves.  <li> It was quite an extreme session, but really, I never felt in danger at all. It wasn't that bad, just a lot of paddling. Eric was like: "dude, you're fucking nuts", but I totally disagree. Besides, he was referring to the insane paddling, which I handled well while he's not a super strong paddler. There were no currents either, and no wind. I think what prompted him to say that also was my insanely intense take-off on the 2ft-overhead close-out. I have to say, when I made the drop I felt like I was jumping off a building. I am really happy I made it to my feet though and made that drop. On a day of close-outs like this, you just have to throw yourself over the ledge and eat it, rather than wait for a good corner for 1 hour.  <li> And yes, I guess it was an extreme session because when I got home, I lied on the bed and slept for 1 hour like a rock, and woke up in a total daze.  <li> I lost the hat twice after wiping out, but got it right back. Very good thing it floats. </ul></blockquote>

Anyway, I look on the horizon and  there is this head-high wave that looks like it may hold. I put my  hat back on my head and scrambled over that wave as I had seen the  shadow of another wave behind it. That one looked better and I  dropped in, on a semi-sketchy take-off. At that point, my hat fell  in front of my face and got stuck right in front of my eyes as I am  taking-off, because I had had no time to latch it on. The hat then gets stuck there due to the speed and I have to  reach with my hand to remove it. I basically did the whole  head-high take-off completely blind. By the time I removed the hat,  I had gone too low on the bottom-turn and the wave was heaving  above my head. I had to bail because everything came crashing down.  I think it was a makable wave that could have been the wave of the  day. Damn you hat. Damn you!  <li> 1 see turtle on the outside </ul></blockquote>

Met Patrick out there, nobody else out.  <li> A tad windy, waist-high, very inconsistent but getting a little  bit better as the tide dropped.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple fun ones. At one point a shoulder-high set came, and Patrick got a pretty good ride on the first wave while I caught the third one. That was the highlight.  <li> Overall more fun than expected. On the paddle out there was that  pitbull-looking dog in the water, with his owner who was swimming.  That dog was on fire, barking his head off and swimming after me as  I was paddling out for quite a while. I think he just wanted to  play, but it was a bit odd. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 7:30AM-9AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself. Met Eric and later Jim in the line-up.  <li> Glassy, waist- to head-high, inconsistent and slow due to the  high tide, glassy.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves throughout most of the session with nothing  special. My first wave was an outstanding wave but I had just  gotten to the line-up and I was too far inside and I ate it  on a super-late take-off.  <li> It wasn't a good session in the sense that I had woken up late  after a week without surfing because my sleeping schedule was  off all week. I felt super sluggish in the water and by the time I  got to the water the tide was too high.  <li> At the end of the sessions there was a super long lull and I couldn't wait for a last wave to get out of there. Jim  was the only one left at that point and he caught a nice but slow  waist-high wave. I then turned around as a  beautiful head-high slow wave had started forming on the outside. I  dropped in. The wave then hacked up and barely held but was lined-up all the way  to the inside. I didn't have any options for maneuvers so I just  locked in in a super high line and flew all the way in. It  made this pretty pitiful session into a great one in the end and  I walked away feeling great.  <li> 1 dolphin on the outside </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:45AM-8:45AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself for 1/2 hour. Met Larry and Rob, and later Eric and his future son-in-law John. Two other people out.  <li> A bit bumpy, waist- to shoulder-high, not consistent and slow/odd due to the high time.  <li> Caught about 20 waves, with a couple of fun ones, but I was never in position for the best ones. Many waves sort of petered out due to too much water moving around.  <li> The first 1/2 hour by myself was really lame, but waves started showing up after Larry and Rob paddled out.  <li> Nice conversations in the line-up, waves for everybody, nothing great but quite pleasant. A few nice head-high sets but I was never in the right spot for those.  <li> The 2 "other" people out were there with their entire families watching from the shore. Sort of funny. They didn't catch too many waves. </ul></blockquote>
