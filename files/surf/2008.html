 <li> Chasm, 4PM-5:30PM  <li> on Kathy's 8'2''  <li> With Dario, about 20 people out  <li> waist-high with a few chest-high sets, not breaking as usual. Caught  3 waves, with a couple of sort of fun rights.  We were sitting a little  bit South of the main peak, but it was very difficult to see where to  position oneself today.  <li> Completely out of shape. On the first paddle for a wave I thought I  actually had tweaked something in my neck.  <li> Overall a nice little session to get back into surfing, with decent  weather although it looked incredibly foggy from the road.  <li> There was a huge seal on the beach, alive but barely moving. Not sure if it was sick or just sleeping.  <li> Getting to the parking lot in the dark, cold evening wasn't the most pleasant experience. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Chasm, 6:30AM-8:30AM  <li> on Kathy's 8'2''  <li> With Dario, Travis, Art and Allister, only 1 other guy out at our peak  <li> chest- to head-high, but oddly shaped and difficult to get into, with  the occasional head-high+ outside set that nobody was ever even close to.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, with a decent left. Nothing too special, except my being totally out of shape of course. Really amazing. Toward the end of the  session I was basically exhausted, and so was Travis who hadn't surfed in many months. Dario wasn't in the best shape either. It was a bit pathetic.  <li> The walk back to the trail was interesting with the tide a bit high. We had to put our leashes back on and paddle around that pointe in a mix of backwash and incoming waves. It brought me back to that session with Travis on May 21 2005. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Paradise, 6AM-7:15AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself, nobody out.  <li> ankle- to knee-high, very weak and inconsistent. Glassy at first and rather windy at the end.  <li> I had to paddle out after coming back to Hawai`i, in spite of almost no waves and a slightly high tide. Not surprisingly there was almost nobody out, but for 2 guys at Pops. The water was much colder than I've ever really seen it and I was glad that I was wearing my neoprene tank top under my rashguard!  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with only one waist-high wave that resembled a wave. Great workout though, with quite a bit of paddling around. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2008_January_15">Tue 15 January 2008</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Paradise, 6:30AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 9'6'', no leash  <li> By myself, nobody out. 10 people at Pops including 2-3 SUPs that were catching rides all the way to the beach. One paddleboarder paddled through.  <li> knee-high, weak and inconsistent but a bit better than yesterday. Glassy and then windier, but less so than yesterday.  <li> Caught about 15 waves. There was a 1/2 hours when waves were coming in rather regularly. Pops had better shape and longer rides, but had the usual crew of older guys on 12ft boards, so I just hung out at Paradise. Initially I thought it would be completely flat and I was going to paddle around for the workout in an effort to get back in shape. But given that there was something out there I ended up spending the whole session at Paradise.  <li> Not sure what's going on but it's definitely colder than usual in Hawai`i this winter. Walking back to the car an feeling cold is definitely a new experience. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 6:15AM-7:15AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself, up to 15 people out at the end including Jim, Eric, Clarence, Doug, etc.  <li> waist- to chest-high, glassy, not very consistent but nice sets coming in once in a while. Oddly the inside section was sort of closing out a bit.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with nothing great. I missed two great sets. One because it was too dark to see it coming, the other one because I was just paddling back from a crappy ride.  <li> I didn't surf well at all today but still had fun. It was good to see everybody again and all.  <li> 1 sea turtle 20ft from the beach. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2008_January_19">Sat 19 January 2008</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 7:45AM-9:30AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> With Tom. 2-3 people out, including Jay and then Patrick.  <li> Waist-high with a few higher sets coming in. Not very consistent and quite a bit of texture in the water.  <li> Caught about 20 waves, with 3-4 fun rights that lined up nicely.  <li> Overall a fun session. One of those when you leave the session feeling like the conditions weren't good but surprised at how fun it was. Amazing full double rainbow as well. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2008_January_20">Sun 20 January 2008</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 11AM-12PM  <li> on my 9'2'', no leash  <li> By myself. Nobody out (1 guy paddling in as I was paddling out, and 2 girls paddling out while I was paddling in)  <li> Knee- to waist-high, really inconsistent and windy.  <li> Pretty much terrible conditions but I paddled out just for the workout. Only 3 nice sets came in and I caught only one of them for a decent ride. I caught perhaps 10 waves total. It was a great workout because the wind was consistently blowing me towards Ewa and I pretty much paddled non-stop for 1 hour. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Tongs, 8AM-9AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> With Tom, 2-3 other people out.  <li> Knee- to waist-high, inconsistent and windy, even rainy at times.  <li> Caught about 10 waves with only 2 sort of fun.  <li> Tom was totally gung-ho to go surfing this morning, so I abided.  There was a guy paddling back in as I was setting up and we talked  a bit about my Stewart. He said it was better than it looked out  there, but it sort of wasn't :)  <li> Sort of a ridiculous session, but oddly fun once again. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2008_January_22">Tue 22 January 2008</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Haleiwa, 7:30AM-9:30AM  <li> on my 8'2''  <li> With Patrick, 10 to 20 other people out.  <li> waist- to head-high, moderate winds, not consistent, fat and very difficult to get into waves.  <li> This first North Shore session of the year (and only 2nd  overall!) really was sort of a letdown (although it's always fun to  be out in the water, etc.). Waves were very odd and very difficult  to get into. The only guy who had a decent session was an old  crusty on his 11ft board. I would have been much better off with my  9'6''. Initially during the session a great head-high set came  through, but that was pretty much the only nice set.  <li> Caught 3 waves, with really nothing good. A fast right that  closed out almost immediately, a bumpy waist-high left, and my last  right to come in but that also closed out.  <li> Never have I paddled for waves so much in a session and ridden so  few. I was shut out for an hour, but so was pretty much everybody  else. Many guys paddled out, stayed for 45 minutes, didn't ride a wave, and just went in. Furthermore, there were reports of other spots that didn't look good either. I guess just a bad morning to be out there. Oh well. next time.  <li> Several turtles in the line-up. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2008_January_22">Tue 22 January 2008</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Canoes, 9:30PM-10:45PM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> with Larry, nobody out but for a guy with a head light for 5 minutes.  <li> knee to almost waist-high, not super consistent but better towards the end of the session.  <li> Caught about 8-10 waves, with 3 nice lefts that kept going forever. Larry got a lot of those. At the beginning of the session, right as we paddled out, a nice set cam along, but then almost nothing for 1/2 hour before it started working again.  <li> As usual, the night surfing experience is quite magical and tonight the skies were clear with a full moon, which made it all the better. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2008_February_3">Sun 3 February 2008</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Flies, 11AM-12:30PM  <li> on my 9'6'', no leash  <li> with Larry, nobody out but for one guy for 10 minutes and one guy at the end as we were paddling in.  <li> waist- to occasional chest-high, with sometimes even slightly bigger on the peak, not very nicely shaped and a bit windy, but definitely fun waves coming through.  <li> Really serendipitous session. Larry came down to the lanai and told me that he was going to check out Flies just to get wet. The expectation was that there would be absolutely no waves. It was such a great surprise to show up there to see white water and sets coming in!  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with a few really fun rights. Pretty out of shape after a long time without surfing and right after a yoga lesson, but really fun. I blew a couple of nicely shaped waves and took a little bit more time than usual to get back to the line up. Leashes wouldn't have been such a bad idea actually. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2008_February_6">Wed 6 February 2008</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Queens, 6:15AM-7:15AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> with Larry, nobody out at first in the dark, and at the end about 15 other people out.  <li> waist-high, glassy, not very consistent but nice waves coming through once in a while.  <li> Caught 4 waves, with 2 nice one. The first one was my first wave, caught in the dark, and I ended up losing it after a couple of turns because I just couldn't see it. The second one was toward the end of the session, and I caught it while being outside of the pack. A nicely shaped waist-high wave with a long nice wall. Pretty lucky.  <li> I had never surfed Queens before, and the wave is really nice. The problem is that the take-off area is pretty small and the crowd becomes a problem. Although the vibe was mellow, I had to back off quite a few times to give people the right-of-way. </ul></blockquote>
<h2> <a name="2008_February_7">Thu 7 February 2008</a> </h2><blockquote><ul>
 <li> Paradise, 6:15AM-7:45AM  <li> on my 9'6''  <li> paddled out with Eric. Later showed up Jim, Clarence, Ron, Yvette and her friend  <li> waist- to chest-high, glassy, a bit weak with only a few waves having a wall (only the rights were working).  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 5 outstanding walled up chest-high waves. I don't know what was going on but I had amazing good wave karma today. Everybody was complaining that I always seemed to find myself right on the peak for the best set waves, again and again. Two of these rights especially were outstanding (for a day with supposedly no swell!!), with a nice wall to get on high lines, then setup for a bottom turn, and again, all the way to the inside. The others were weakening after the first couple of sections. I can't remember a session with all those guys out during which I caught so many more nice waves than they did. They were jokingly pissed off and kept asking me to go home. Eric was telling me it was because I wasn't wearing the hat! It just seemed that they would always all scramble to catch the last wave of the set, but there was always another much better a little bit after the set, for which I was just perfectly positioned and alone, with everybody watching me ride it as they were paddling back.  <li> Amazing how Paradise delivered on a day when Threes was basically not working as far as we could tell (Mitch and Nathan were out there though).  <li> A lot of talking and laughing in the line-up, beautiful rainbow  while paddling back in. Nice way to start the day. </ul></blockquote>

Felt exhausted in the line-up, after  5 days being sick with that stomach flu that has been going around.  But I felt pretty good after getting out of the water.  <li> Nice sunset at the end. </ul></blockquote>

A couple of decent sets came through,  but this swell is definitely over.  <li> 1 Seal toward the harbor </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 6:30AM-7:20AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> By myself. Alone for 1/2 hour, then 8 people out including Doug and his daughter and friends, and Paula who moved back to Hawai`i after 1.5 years in Germany! Clarence as well.  <li> knee- to waist- with the very occasional higher peak, glassy, pseudo-consistent, but sort of weird and weak.  <li> Caught about 20 waves, with one very fun lined-up right above waist-high, and a couple of others.  <li> Nice talking to Doug and Paula as I hadn't seen him in a while and her in over a year obviously.  <li> Paddled in early to go to class, and put quarters in Doug's park-meter so that he could stay out until 9. He leaves quarters on the roof of his car and that way any time somebody goes in he just asks them to feed the meter. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Canoes, 9:45PM-11PM  <li> on my 9'6'', no leash  <li> With Larry, and 5 of his friends with 2 of them on bodyboards. 3 other guys out. Many people with glowsticks.  <li> waist-high, glassy, sort of consistent with just a 15-minute lull halfway through the session.  <li> Caught about 15 waves with 2 or 3 really nice solid waist-high rights  <li> Really nice session, with a beautiful moon out. The inside was a bit of an obstacle course with Larry's friends there, but nothing too bad.  <li> I felt sort of bad for the 3 guys out who were in the line-up  before we paddled out. As we were showing up they were lighting up  a joint out there and we sort of killed their vibe.  <li> At the end of the session Larry and his posse went out for a beer while I went home directly bringing both our boards back to the house. </ul></blockquote>

Super glassy and amazingly clear water.  <li> Decided to go at low tide just in case the swell that's supposed to hit this morning started to show an figuring out that at low tide there would be something anyway. Turned out that there were a few occasional waves, but nothing to really write about. Stood up 10 times with only a couple of real waves. Enjoyed the beautiful day and afterwards went for a bagel to the bakery on Cooke. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Rainbows, 11:30PM-1:45PM  <li> on my 9'2'', no leash  <li> With Eric. Nobody out but one SUP beginner for 1/2 hour.  <li> Ankle- to knee-high, with the very occasional waist-high wave. Pretty weak but breaking. At times glassy, at times choppy.  <li> I started the morning checking Flies which had size but was completely blown out by Kona winds. I called Eric to find out about Rainbows and turns out I had just missed him by 5 minutes at Flies and he was headed to the North Shore. I went back home super fast, packed a bunch of stuff, and engaged pursuit. Met him and Tracy at Left Overs, which was terrible. Sunset was even worse. So we went to Rainbows. It was tiny but we just felt like paddling out. Tracy opted out, so it was only Eric and I.  <li> I must have caught 40 waves. It was a huge workout actually as always when trying to ride everything that moves. Absolutely stunning views from the line-up with Chinaman's Hat, the valley in the back. Really soulful session.  <li> Paddled in and then I took Eric to his house under heavy rain. I ended up staying there for lunch eating Saimin that his wife made and some sandwiches on his deck looking out to the ocean as the weather had cleared up. After that I went to visit Jen and Red, and finally dinner at Guylaine's, back at home at 11PM. A pretty long day overall. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:40AM-7:40AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> With Eric. Justin was out and one other guy. A third guy paddled  out as Justin went in.  <li> Glassy, waist- to head-high, a bit odd and quite a few closeouts,  but also some very nice waves coming through. Conditions  deteriorated throughout the session.  <li> Caught about 6 waves, with a couple of very nice head-high peaks  and shoulder high walls that held until the usual close-out  section. That section was actually easy to go around and it was  possible on most waves to reconnect to the shoulder on the inside  reform. My surfing wasn't great today, but it was overall a pretty  fun session. Not sure how long this swell's going to last, but it  looked like it was fading pretty fast.  <li> On one head-high+ close-out I was hugging the wall and ended up diving through the wall right before it closed out on me. Eric on the inside was jokingly saying afterward: dude, you got almost barreled. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 6:30AM-7:45AM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> With Eric and Justin. up to 9 people out at some point including Carl, Patrick, and that guy from South Africa whose name I can never recall.  <li> waist- to shoulder-high, glassy, bigger waves coming in but closing out.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, including 3-4 outstanding chest-high waves that were perfectly lined up with series of fast sections. I surfed much better than yesterday and had a great time. </ul></blockquote>

Tried a left but as often it was closing out pretty fast.  <li> The swell definitely backed down throughout the session, and tomorrow may be really small. But today was really fun and it was nice to witness some Threes perfection. Amazingly beautiful day today with not a cloud in the sky. </ul></blockquote>

Still had fun thought. A couple of waves were fun. On one wave  Larry and I were paddling for it and although it looked like it  was going to be a mellow ride, the wave jacked up suddenly and we  both completely ate it (I even lost my hat). On the last nice  wave that I attempted, after a pretty decent take off, I simply  wasn't ready for the speed and I fell backward in the wall.  Pretty lame. It was kind of amazing how even on a day that was  sort of day, knee-high ripples would jack up an create pretty  steep and powerful peaks. </ul></blockquote>

But it was very social, with groups of people talking on the outside.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, all small insiders, but with a few of them sort of hollow and fun somehow.  <li> Just a mellow, if very social session really. </ul></blockquote>

We started at Queens  and I caught about 5 waves there, but very quickly the crowd  began becoming way too much, with about 15 people out, some of  them very loud. On our last waves there we had to swerve between  so many people that we called it quit and paddled over to Canoes.  <li> Initially at Canoes there we only a few people out, but we soon  were about 10, with several from Queens who had paddled over.  Caught about 5-6 waves there, including a very nice left.  <li> Overall, still pretty fun. Mental note though: no moonlight  surfing before a day off. </ul></blockquote>

Only 2-3 waves looked  remotely like Threes.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 2 that were fun and smooth.  <li> Some guy paddled out on a longboard wearing a snorkel and surfing  with it.

I caught a  great one at the end, with a nice smooth wall. Dario caught a couple  of decent ones, especially toward the end.  <li> Great conversation in the line-up with Jim.

 <li> Right Overs, 7AM-8:45AM  <li> on my 9'6''  <li> With Dario (on my 8'2''). From 5 to 20 other people out, including SUPs  <li> Head-high to 2ft-overhead, glassy, super clean and smooth  <li> We opted for a North Shore session and it completely paid off. We ended  up surfing Right Overs because Left Overs was sort of owned by shortboarders.  Had never surfed Right Overs before. That wave is slow, but with this size  it was super fun and amazingly clean. The take-offs were so smooth it was  incredible. I can't remember gliding into such big waves with such ease. It sort of  blew our minds. Besides, the morning was glorious with the view of the mountains and the beach.  Quite the experience.  <li> Caught 10+ waves, with incredible long smooth rights. It had been a long  time since I had dropped on such big waves and the feeling was incredible.  <li> Both Dario and I were completely stoked and ecstatic. The vibe in the crowd  was super friendly, with SUP riders hooting us into waves (?!?@#). We talked a bit  to a lady there who seemed to be a regular fixture in the line-up.  At some  point some guy on an SUP complimented me on my board. After I told him I  had bought it for very cheap he gave me a double shaka and said "Scooooore". It  was so friendly out there is was crazy. At the end of the session I asked him  the best way to get back in actually.  <li> It was an absolutely amazing session.  I was so calm and relaxed through the  whole thing it was weird. I don't know. One would think that after surfing waist-high  South shore for a while I'd be sketched out by 8ft faces... odd.  <li> 1 big turtle on the inside. </ul></blockquote>

One lady out with her nephew.  <li> Waist-high, not very clean or consistent and getting windier by the minute.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with nothing special. We tried to score  two nice sessions in the same day, but it didn't quite happen. A few  waves were sort of more lined up and one bigger set came, perhaps foreshadowing  the South swell to come.  <li> That lady was surfing pretty well, but the amusing thing is that  although she was supposed to teach her nephew, she was just saying:  "yeah, he's on the inside, I can't see what he's doing, it's so  hard to teach people", and she kept riding wave after wave. It was  pretty hilarious really. And I am totally with her on this. </ul></blockquote>

Due to the decrease in size  Right Over wasn't working.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, mostly lefts, with none of the bigger ones but a few  fun shoulder-high ones. Dario, on his first wave, got a screaming left that  blew his mind, which was pretty cool. He however noted that the inside was super  shallow and sketchy.  <li> The vibe was pretty friendly out there. The lady from yesterday  paddled out. Turns out her name's Debbie. She's really friendly and  gave us tons of information regarding the spot. We talked to her  again once by the cars and she explained us how to paddled to and  handle Alligators, which was really nice. She actually built one of  the houses on the shore right by Left Overs, but now she lives  across the street. Quite amazing.  <li> A local shortboarder paddled out at some point, with an  incredibly mean expression on his face. He looked like a total  serial killer. We were a bit sketched out. I mean, if people told me  to try to look like I wanted to murder somebody I couldn't muster a face  one tenth as scary as his. Everybody else was super mellow though.  <li> A whale was rolling around outside the line-up, which was pretty  cool. Saw another sea turtle as well while paddling out.  <li> On my last wave, I caught that shoulder-high left that was pretty  fun, and, somehow, I rode it too far in. I had sort of forgotten  Dario's warning about the inside, and I suddenly found myself in  2ft of water. I kicked out, but the board didn't make it over the  wave (luckily I did). I was then in white water, with my feet on  the coral bottom. Not too cool but no harm done. When I got back on  my board I saw a ding on the nose. Quite severe but highly fixable.  After struggling to paddle back out for 5 minutes I realized I  was tired and that it was time to go in.  I was sort of stuck by  the shelf on the inside anyway, so I simply got in right by the  shelf in deep water. I took pictures from the car until Dario  showed up. He was a bit concerned because he never saw me go in,  but all was well. </ul></blockquote>

There  were still more close-outs than usual, but we manage to drop in  quite a few fun ones. In particular, our last waves in were  pretty good, Dario's being his best South Shore wave so far.

So I drove to rainbows. When I got there the conditions looked messy but the winds were indeed very light. So I paddled out for the experience and the workout. The conditions were very much victory at sea, with tons of peaks everywhere.  <li> Caught 5 waves, with a couple of fun and sketchy drops. But of course the wall was a complete mess. There was no way to line up on anything. Just wait, and when a peak show up 5 yards in front of you, just turn and drop in. There were no currents though, which was good because I was completely alone out there.  <li> After about 40 minutes the wind started howling, pretty much all of a sudden. The sky got all dark and it was time to go in. I caught some white water in. By the time I got to the beach the wind had become a gale. I had a very hard time putting my board back into the bag and putting the whole thing on my car. I had to hang on to everything at all times. Part of me always likes these ridiculous sessions.

Glassy at first, then windy, then glassy again.  <li> Better conditions than yesterday I'd say, although there were still  many close-outs. Caught a total of perhaps 10 waves. The paddle back  was pretty long due to waves closing out in the head-high range in the  channel during sets, but nothing too terrible.  <li> On my first wave I struggled to make it down the face (it was  perhaps 1ft overhead) and I ended up taking off too late. My bottom  turn was just too fast and I did a face plant into the face, thus  going over the falls. I was held down quite a bit and got another  one on the head. Not a great start for the session. But in the end  I had about 3-4 waves that were great, with quite a rush on the  take off, and a nice fast section before the close-out.  <li> Toward the end of the session Eric shouted me into a wave that  turned out to be probably the best one of the session.  <li> Overall a pretty good session, which was quite a workout. It wasn't  as sketchy as I had thought it would be given the surf forecast.  Spots like Threes were probably on fire, but probably crowded as  hell.

Not very consistent.  <li> Caught 8 waves, with a couple of fun ones. It was a bit of a challenge  today with my 8'2'', also because I felt a bit surfed out. But I really  enjoy several of my take-offs and I don't think I did too badly on that board.  <li> I had a pretty spectacular wipe-out. A head-high+ wave sort of  jacked up right in front of me and since the guys on the outside  didn't go for it and tried the famous "turn and burn". I think it  was makable, but I was just a bit out of my league and I fell in  front of the board. The board then went over the falls, and then I  did. I ended up pretty deep, with the leash tangled around my legs. I  eventually came up and was fine. Justin saw the whole thing from the inside and he was impressed.  <li> Today in fact, since I was sitting  further inside, I took a few waves on the head in the impact zone  of the bigger sets. Clearly would've caught more waves on my 9'6'',  but still a good experience being there on the 8'2''. The paddles  back out were sort of grueling at times, or I guess just long waiting for multi-set waves to pass.  <li> I got out of the water sort of early to make it to my Italian class,  but also because I was simply exhausted.  <li> There was a boat stranded on the reef at Kewalo.

Larry and I paddled out there wondering  what was up with the bodyboarders. We each caught a wave right  in the middle of them, and at some point heard a horn. In  retrospect, the rashguards all of different colors should have  tipped us off!  Anyway, there was that bodyboarding contest  going on, with a tent on the shore, etc.  So we stayed at a reasonable  distance. That contest was pretty sad due to the poor conditions.  It could have been better in the morning with the low tide though  (there was a longboarding part to the contest as well).  <li> Caught only 4-5 waves, but including 2 fun ones that held decently well  and were above waist-high with somewhat of a wall. Those were far in between though due  to the tide.  <li> After another heat ended (the conditions were so poor it was  actually difficult to keep track of when heats were going on  or not), and we paddled in, making our way through the crowd  of kids playing on the stairs as usual. </ul></blockquote>

Caught 2 waves in the first 1/2 hour and really nothing to write home about. However, at one point, there were some shadows on the horizon and I paddled a bit further out. Lo and behold, that beautiful chest-high wave came in. I dropped in and the wall was absolutely perfect, completely open. I had a great ride, series of bottom-turns and going up to a high line to make the faster sections. Some guy on the inside after the fact told me he'd been here all morning and this was only the 2nd time such a wave came through. Nobody caught the one before, I could tell he was jealous telling me I caught the wave of the day. I should really have gone home after this. Instead I spent 1/2 hour waiting for another wave, and another chest-high one came in, but this time a close out. I made the drop, and then rode the white water all the way in.  <li> So, overall very lame condition, but hard to be displeased after such a good wave. Felt pretty sluggish out there after so long without surfing due to that pesky sinus infection I've been dragging for weeks. </ul></blockquote>

Pretty happy about that one, especially giving the  no leash situation.  <li> Larry was surfing his shortboard, and in spite of the high tide  caught quite a few waves really.  <li> Absolutely great being back in the water and in decent shape, nice  conversations, good vibe.

Apparently Justin and Eric on the  inside where hooting their asses off and said afterward it was  quite something to behold, giving me points for grit. They couldn't  believe I dropped in on that thing.  That wave sort of took it out  of me a little bit, it was really intense.  After that I took it  easy and ended the session early to go in, get into work quickly  before flying out to Maui for that team-marathon thing.  <li> So the conditions weren't as good as they could've been, and it  was a bit crowded, but overall a really fun session.

Flies wasn't  holding it at all though, expectedly. Justin went to Tongs, and  he said that it was pretty big and getting better when some guy  yelled "shark!". It was mass hysteria, as everybody paddled in.  Apparently there was a boogie-boarder trailing everybody who was  freaking out.

Turns out  Clarence had tried to go left, but some guy was also going left,  so he opted for the right too late. He was trying to be nice and  let me have it I guess, although I was in the better spot to  begin with. Definitely the wave of the day. Eric said that from  the inside it looked just fantastic. Even on the tail end of the  swell I guess there are still some good waves to be had.  <li> Nice conversation in the water. There was a very old guy out there,  didn't quite catch his name (Greg?), and everybody said you had  to give him a wide berth because he'll just drop in, wipe out, no  matter where, no matter how big.

It was pretty  difficult finding the lined-up ones today.  <li> At some point this much bigger set (2ft overhead at least) came  through. I barely made it past it and everybody behind was  annihilated. After that one, it seems that the swell died and there  was nothing for 20 minutes with stronger and stronger winds.  Eventually I caught a tiny insider back to the stairs.  <li> As I was showering  I was looking at the line-up. A chest-high set  came through. Molokai's friend took off deep and starting coming  down the line fast toward a close-out section, on a shortboard.  Beyond that section that guy dropped in on his massive red  longboard. I had seen the guy two days ago. About 50 years old,  not surfing well at all, with many botched take-offs. Clearly  a beginner. That day I felt a little bit bad because I had perhaps  caught too many waves. On the other hand he never seemed in position  to catch anything, and when by chance he was he botched the  take-offs. Yesterday he was there too, and told me something  that I didn't completely understand, something about me catching  lots of waves. So I figured he was pissed that I had been a wave  hog the day before, which I guess one could say I was. Anyway, today  he padded over and started apologizing for being in the way,  telling that he'd stay out of the way today, etc. Very odd, but  nice. I told him to chill, that the spot was sort of mellow.  Anyway, as I am showering I watch him drop on that wave, which is  not a problem because he's in front of a close-out section with  a nice wall ahead of him on the right. No way he's going to even  get close to that other guy, right? Well, he did a very lame  take-off, halfway on his knees, and then proceeded to go left,  toward the close-out instead of the wall. That's when the collision  happened. Basically he got hit in the ankles by the shortboard,  both boards T-boned each other. It was a mess. Clearly board  damage, and perhaps some injury as well. After a moment of  confusion the shortboarder paddled back out. On the one hand  I feel that that guy's sort of a menace on a day when the waves  are of decent sizes. On the other hand, I felt bad for him that  after trying to be nice to "the crew" he causes a major  accident. Not sure if we'll see him again. I'd definitely stay  away for a while.  <li> One turtle outside of the line-up. </ul></blockquote>

Beautiful morning, with few waves,  sort of odd conditions, but with the occasional nicely shaped  waist-high peak.  <li> The three of us talked a lot because we weren't surfing that  much, and at some point we heard a big splash. Ron and I were facing  toward the splash and we instantly and clearly saw a big black shape, with  a big fin, going down in the water, on its way to the outside,  perhaps 25 yards from us. Ron also saw the tail moving sideways with  a big wake.  99% sure it was a shark. On the moment I said it looked about 6ft  in length, and Ron agreed that it was big. That was perhaps  overestimating things a bit. But I would say definitely more than 5  ft. The back of that thing looked quite massive. Ron immediately  wanted to paddled in. Jim wasn't too fazed, but of course he hadn't  seen it. I was sort of in between. We ended up laughing it off, sort  of, and hanging out for another 20 minutes. Doug came by on his  SUP and we envied his paddle that can be used as a weapon.  At some point I caught a decent wave, and as I was paddling back out I saw  that both Jim and Ron had caught one behind mine and were going  in.  Ron was like "bye bye" as he surfed by, and I thought there  was no way I was going to stay by myself. Would be pretty stupid:  "yeah, after seeing a big shark, I stayed out alone to catch  knee-high waves". So I paddled in, with Jim and Ron waiting  for me in the inside laughing at my clear determination for not  staying out by myself.  <li> Beautiful morning though. </ul></blockquote>

Both of them  found that swimming and just let the board drag behind them  was much less tiring and more efficient than paddling... pretty common  for beginners I guess.

 <li> Threes, 6:30AM-7:30AM  <li> on my 9'6''.  <li> with Larry. Mitch out, who went to Paradise halfway through  the session.  <li> Knee-high, very weak due the high tide, inconsistent, glassy.  <li> Caught about 5-6 waves, very short rides. Botched a couple of  late take-offs on surprise waves that came through.  <li> Beautiful sunrise, one turtle on the outside. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Flies, 3PM-4PM  <li> on my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> By myself, nobody out.  <li> knee-high, mild winds, barely breaking.  <li> Just felt like going out in the water in spite of the lame conditions.  <li> Caught 4-5 tiny waves, and other than that just sat on the board  watching Diamond Head, paddled around, and relaxed.  <li> One turtle right by the jetty. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> In Betweens, 4:30PM-5:30PM  <li> on my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> By myself, 15-20 people out.  <li> knee-high to sometimes waist-high, glassy, not consistent.  <li> After checking Flies, which was flat in spite of the low tide, I  went to the Kaiser parking lot to look at In Betweens and decided to  paddle out. Very mellow and beautiful session. Caught 6-7 waves, with  a couple of long knee-high perfectly glassy ones over the coral.  Couldn't ask for a more relaxing experience really. The crowd was  on the main peak and I was off to the side with only a few people.  A couple of very good longboarders were truly tearing it up in  spite of the tiny waves.  <li> Once back in the parking lot I hung out for 20 minutes watching  the sun set. There were two soul-surfer-type guys in the beat up  minibus next to me (license plate "SRF WDG") covered in  marijuana-themed stickers. Pretty classic. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Threes, 6:30AM-7:45AM  <li> on my 9'6'', no leash.  <li> With Larry. One other guy out for 1/2 hour, then Clarence and Craig paddled out.  <li> knee-high, glassy, inconsistent, rather weak but still nice quality  to the wave.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with a couple of decently long smooth ones.  <li> Craig hadn't surfed in 1 year and this was his first time in the  water after that hiatus.  <li> Stunning sunrise. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Canoes, 8:30PM-10:15PM  <li> on my 9'2''  <li> With Larry and Conrad. Met Dave, a friend of Larry's, on the beach.  <li> knee- high with a few waist-high peaks, pseudo glassy, very weak  and not very consistent. Almost no visible moon due to clouds.  <li> Caught 20+ waves, nothing very good save one decent  right and one decent left. Somehow, in spite of the poor visibility  and the very weak waves, I ended up catching a lot of them. </ul></blockquote>
