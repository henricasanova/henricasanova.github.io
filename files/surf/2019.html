 <li> Old Man's, 2:30PM-3:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> By myself. About 20 people out.  <li> Waist-high. Pretty weak with many fake-outs. Just had to be exactly on  the peak to catch something.  <li> A large group of kids as part of a surf school was on the main  peak, and it was a total zoo. I stayed with a few others on the  peak on the right, which is so flaky and strange. Caught a couple  of waves though.  <li> Paddled out just to get wet and to try to get rid of that stupid cold  I've been dragging for days now. I think the ocean helped. </ul></blockquote>

About 20 people out.  <li> Waist- to shoulder-high+, consistent-ish, but rather bumpy and choppy due to moderate winds.  <li> Caught 4-5 waves, including a couple of decent rights. A lot of non-starters. </ul></blockquote>

About 10 people out.  <li> Waist- to chest-high, pretty consistent, light winds.  <li> Caught 10+ waves with 2 or 3 really good rights. Caught a left as well, which is when  I realized that, somehow, I hadn't caught a left in months! Felt pretty awkward... need  to make sure I go left sometimes! </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Diamond Head, 7:15AM-9AM  <li> On my 9'2'' and my 8'2''  <li> With Dario. About 25 people out at the peak.  <li> Waist-high+, glassy, not super consistent, but nicely shaped.  <li> Caught about 15 waves, with 1 really good right. Failed to catch  a couple of outstanding ones, which sort of sucked.  <li> Dario and I swapped boards at about 3/4 of the session, and I caught  3 waves on the 8'2'' which I hadn't surfed in years. Pretty pleasant  actually. </ul></blockquote>

About 20 people out at the peak.  <li> Waist-high, light winds, not as consistent as yesterday.  <li> Caught about 10 waves, with nothing to write home about but for  one decent right.  Long waits. But beautiful weather out there. </ul></blockquote>

 <li> Toes, 1PM-3:30PM  <li> On my 9'6''  <li> With Dario (on my 9'2'' Stewart), Lambert, and Ryan. Nobody else out.  <li> Waist-high, light winds, consistent.  <li> Caught about 30 waves. At the beginning I was catching mostly rights,  which are pretty steep and lead you into the shallows. Fun but a bit  unnerving on a longboard.  Then started going left, and the lefts were  pretty fun, with steep-ish take-offs and then long peeling rides. Beautiful  weather, beautiful views, tons of waves, nobody out, what more to ask.  <li> Very long session. Good thing I sort of got in shape the last week or so.  Still really tired though. </ul></blockquote>

Good timing on our part. </ul></blockquote>

Nobody else out.  <li> Waist-high+, windy, sort of disorganized and choppy, but still some waves coming through  <li> Caught 5-6 waves, with two really good lefts. Caught one right but only for a small section after  kicking out due to shallow reef.  <li> Pretty exhausting session due to the need to constantly paddle to stay in position.  <li> Mostly cloudy with only a few sunny patches. Overall a pretty good session though. </ul></blockquote>

Up to 7-8 other people out.  <li> Waist-high+ with some chest-high peaks, light winds, pretty consistent.  <li> Caught 15+ waves, with several great lefts. Also caught a great right  at a peak west of the main peak, which turns out was working pretty  well as well. Another great session overall, with so many different  waves to catch. </ul></blockquote>

Who knew?  At the end of the session Nodari called last waves. I then caught a  good right. Decided to paddle back out. Caught a good right again.  Decided to paddle back out again. And then caught a great right  as my last wave, which brought be to the stairs.  <li> Nodari and Phil got their slippers stolen on the shore! Only mine  were left untouched.
